What? They don't have to give anyone citizenship. The current Israeli plan is to annex Areas B and C which have few Palestinians. They'll give citizenship to them or offer them to move to area A and recieved the PA greencard. Area A will be annexed as well but will remain under PA administration as autonomous regions under Israeli military contol. The Khazars would never award citizenship to those Palestinians otherwise the Zionist entity's status as a Jewish state is done for.

As for Arabs normalizing relations with Israel: this has already happened with all the states involves in the conflict except Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. Only Arab states that remain in Iran's sphere will remain hostile to Israel, the rest are all purchased.

Seriously? Zeus fathered I don't know how many children with previously virgin women in Greek literature.

Dubya should have been a cautionary tale. But no one paid attention. So the GOP doubled down on cheating and corruption. Now we're all in. 

China is going to be doing really, really well in the coming decades. And that's not even a failing on Trump's part. It's intentional. Read the Steele dossier. 

I guarantee that mid term elections are going to be hacked in some states. We will just see these little articles that prove it, then nothing. Just like we have in the past. It just gets whitewashed. We've already had multiple fraudulent elections. Look at the Georgia election Kennesaw State server wiping thing. I've never seen such blatant election fraud, and there is almost no media about it. We just let it go. 

They are also attacking via social media like in 2016. It's just starting to get ramped up though. And with the success of the 2016 social engineering, everyone and their uncle will be doing it. Except the Democrats, of course, because we are too honest to play the game unfortunately. I don't know why Soros and the other rich liberals don't just go do what they've been accused of by the right. Just hire a bigger team of trolls than the GOP has. They don't have to be Americans, and you can do it perfectly legally if you don't offer to trade US foreign policy for it. Hell, you can hire Americans if you can afford it (though it wouldn't make any sense to do that). 

I'm worried that the US has basically already fallen. We just can't see it yet because there is a facade. But they stole the presidency by cheating. They stole the SCOTUS by cheating. They stole the majority in Congress by cheating. We have Mueller and elections on our side. But elections are compromised, and Mueller can't do much except expose the truth - which the right will ignore and Congress will not act on because they are complicit. Our only hope is that we can protect enough elections in key swing states to get back a Dem majority. But it doesn't look like that is going to happen.

changemyview,self.changemyview,Thecoldflame,CMV: Religion should never be considered a valid reason to violate otherwise firm rules.,1,578864,KingInJello,534253302,30555869119,"First, I think you'll find it easier to change your view if you consider examples where religious justification has been used to break rules you disagree with. Some Christians used their faith as reasons to free slaves and hide Nazis from the Jews. 

Given that -- I'm non-religious also, and one thing I've had to come to grips with is that for many people, religion is the only moral language they possess, or at least are aware of. For most people, when you try to balance your checkbook, you use arithmetic, and when you try to figure out how to live your life, you use your religion. 

So when people say ""I'm doing this because of my religion,"" what they mean is that they're doing it because of some deeply-held moral conviction. I also have deeply-held moral convictions, and would like to be able to take a moral stand against some types of rules, but those moral convictions aren't based on verifiable evidence either. There's no verifiable evidence that eudaimonia or human happiness or whatever is a worthwhile goal -- at some point you have to rest on first principles. 

So, rather than \*excluding\* religion as a basis for moral stands, I think it would be better to \*include\* secular moral beliefs as a basis for moral stands. That way everybody gets to have their deeply held beliefs, and, when appropriate (according to the individual), they can take a stand and face whatever consequences society decides to inflict.

So, if we can link stoicism, lack of emotional exchange, or fear of homosexual stigma to both men and patient outcomes, it seems no more unreasonable to categorize these behaviors than it does to do the same with religion or political orientation.

Our country has a long history of communities coordinating to systematically deny services to groups they dislike.  You can look up ""redlining"" for some real world historical examples.  You can't live your life in a community where you can't get a loan, buy food or sit down at a restaurant.  Any community that has a large majority of the same mind can systematically push out undesirables.  It can be a white neighborhood pushing out black people, Mormons pushing out other atheists, Jewish neighborhoods pushing out Muslims.  Don't get caught on any one particular instance, any small, disliked minority is at threat from the tyranny of the majority and they can use the ballot box to enforce it.

There's no effective way to ban such coordination, and in fact the coordination may not even need to exist if the business owners of a community have the same beliefs or biases.  You can't exercise your positive rights if society is allowed to coordinate in order to shun you for exercising those rights.  So one person's positive right to live freely in a community comes into conflict with a weaker right not to be compelled to take actions you dislike.

The only effective solution to this seems to be to ban discrimination for those protected classes.  Your idea that ""there will always be someone who doesn‚Äôt care and will gladly take anyone‚Äôs money"" has proven false in the past.  If there's some other solution that I'm not thinking of, then feel free to share it.

TrueChristian,self.TrueChristian,ridestraight,Can we talk about The Book of Enoch in here? By that I mean only Enoch 1...,1,25534,cl1ft,534223423,30555866684,"The Book of Enoch has become a fascination of mine in the last several years and I have a group of close Christian friends that I feel comfortable discussing its themes with.

The book is ""psuedographia"" which doesn't deem it heresy, only that some do not believe Enoch penned the book.  It is a very, very old book but not very strong textually (as the NT is).  Enoch was mentioned by Jude and he is a historical OT figure, not to mention other Apostles have alluded to some of the themes he mentioned.

In my studies I've come to the notion that what Enoch discussed was a generally held notion in the 1st Century Church.  The writers of the Septuagint would have believed that fallen angels profaned mankind.  Josephus makes it pretty clear he believed that as a 1st century Jew.

I think the themes discussed by Enoch give us some contextual background to the genocide of Canaan.  Perhaps God's people wiping out an entire culture is more palatable if we believe they were human/alien hybrids.  The verse that states ""Noah was perfect in all his generations"" makes more sense if we look at it as Noah was genetically pure instead of free from sin.

The belief that the Sons of God were just Cainites really doesn't hold up.  I've cross indexed the words for them throughout the OT and that phrase is always linked to beings that seemed to have powers or aspects more than human.  I've heard some people dispute the value of Angels being able to mate with mankind on the basis that Jesus said ""there will be no marrying in heaven"", of course this doesn't stick because they were no longer in heaven when they married the daughters of men.

I personally think all the mythological beings, many of the epic stories, the Ramayana of India and so many things are attributed to the children of men and angels, the Nephilim.

I think this explains the ancient world much better than the accepted narrative.  I've never believed the modernistic, Darwinist belief that we slowly crept out of the dwellings of primate-hood.

Any fool can look at the sum of recorded history and see that ancient cultures were very advanced, in many ways more advanced than our own... only the technology looked different.  Ancient societies in Meso-America, Iran and Turkey all make that pretty clear.

The experts do not have an accurate picture of history.  They put the puzzle pieces together as time goes on but as others said... ""as in the days of Noah"".... or as I say the more things change the more they stay the same.

The_Donald,news.grabien.com,atomolayanatomay,This is what it has come to folks. They aren't even hiding the fact.,1,622610,MisterCappucino,534182204,30555850858," The late 1800s and into the 30s, maybe 40s, America had a ton of commie and fascist and socialist parties. Some of which literally took direction from Stalin and Hitler.  Believe it or not, the Jews and Russians and some Germans that came over started the socialist groups. Now not all of the immigrants that came over did this, they just happened to bring what was happening in Europe at the time here. Some worked and some didnt.. They didn't all get along either. The groups disagreed on types of socialism etc. Fell apart and this went on for some time as other groups disbanded, others picked them up and reformed. The Socialists ended up sticking around and tried to join the democrats early in the century and the democrats at that time kicked them out. Of course history now sees a different time when they finally accepted the socialists. FDR changed all that..Ironically, the neo Nazis actually helped out the blacks and got some to join them, then again the parties started dying out as the dems took in the socialists and what is now the modern dem party.  Both socialism and communism picked the victims in that society and got them to band together but would never make them rich or even middle class. It preyed on them with the slogan, wealth transfer....sound familiar? So this goes on for decades and the blacks and other minorities in America hear this as they are the disenfranchised group by far at the time, and love it. Cant blame them really. Malcolm X and MLK, while he was somewhat conservative, actually wanted socialism to a degree. And so there is the reason why the minorities and other poor white people latched onto the dems. Its what unions are, paying dues for someone to get you a raise lol.  I just read a lot of articles and wiki. Thought it was pretty interesting. Feel free to correct where its needed.

I don‚Äôt know you, OP but I find that there‚Äôs things in your post im finding problematic.
I think you should focus on building a support network first (emphasis friends). once you have this support network, you‚Äôll prolly feel less concerned about dating. Focus on your giyur first. Focus on building your jewish literacy. Read more about different types of jewish communities
To me, you sound very lonely and that maybe the dating discussion will compensate for that loneliness?
 
Now, I don‚Äôt understand why you rather not date a black jewish man. Yes, it‚Äôt true that gerim might be pared with other black jews by choice or by birth but so what? it‚Äôs not the first time that I read this coming from African americans jews disliking the idea of dating a fellow black and interestingly, they always want to date/have a preference for a white Ashkenazi and never consider a Sephardi. Why? Because Sephardim are darker? (yes, I know that there are Sephardim who are white as the clouds but you guys get what I mean) regardless, some of it borders on self-hate to me to me. Im aware of the notion that for a black man to date a white woman is not the same as a black woman dating a white man (the problem of black women being at the bottom when it comes to desirability) yet, if I were you, I would keep my options open. Leave the baggage of the secular world in the secular world. The jewish world is different.
 
Another thing is that you have a very pedestal-oriented notion of Chabad and chabadniks. Before jumping into Chabad, I would read more about it, visit Chabad synagogues and really familiarize yourself with Chabad philosophy and the community itself.

also, there‚Äôs a Chabad rabbi who does conversions in Brooklyn. ",2018-06-26 19:39:12 UTC,1,0,/r/Judaism/comments/8u118i/do_lubavitchers_marry_gerut/e1c5tv3/

askgaybros,self.askgaybros,craterful,Does racism against white people exist?,1,80559,ydobees,534221094,30555832997,"Here's a problem: the way OP uses the word ""racism"" is not the way it has been traditionally used. Racism was originally a scientific concept later shown to be pseudoscience. It was, per the OED, ""a belief that the members of different racial or ethnic groups possess specific characteristics, abilities, or qualities, which can be compared and evaluated."" Prior to the eighteenth & nineteenth centuries, there was no such concept as race. It arose as a descriptive concept for classing humans into groups based on supposed phenotypes and lineages.

Because the word was caught up in comparing classes of people, the word later came to mean, per the OED, ""A belief that one‚Äôs own racial or ethnic group is superior, or that other such groups represent a threat to one's cultural identity, racial integrity, or economic well-being.""

Based on the above definitions, yes, racism against ""white people"" can, does, and has existed (esp. against subgroups like Irish, Italians, etc.)

However, in the past forty-or-so years, many people have become critical of traditional interpretations of racism--hence, **critical race theory**. This is a perspective that criticizes traditional perspectives on race by saying that racism is not encoded in beliefs, as our dictionaries tell us it is, but rather in systems and institutions, as OP has articulated here.

*BUT* the critical view of race still relies on the fundamental assertion that race is a constructed category--i.e., ""races"" do not simply exist in nature--they are a concept that groups of humans create to understand, think about, conceptualize, and subjugate one another. ""Racism"" isn't simply the system that oppresses people: it's the system that creates the idea of races to begin with by asserting that it makes sense to think about human groupings by phenotype, which it really doesn't (until we make a society where it does by believing that it does--which is kinda where we're at).

When OP says

< one can be prejudiced against white people or hold prejudiced beliefs...but this is not the same as racism

it's important to be reflexive of the fact that this contradicts the dictionary definition and the historical use of the word. It's a new interpretation of the concept. It would do better to position the argument as a critique rather than as, ""y'all misunderstand the word despite what authoritative dictionaries have to say on the matter.""

Furthermore, by using the term ""white people"" as though it describes a salient, cohesive group, OP is participating in ""racism"" by maintaining that it makes sense to understand groups of human beings based on phenotypical characteristics. It's beyond dispute that skin color contributes to instances of prejudice in ways that are systemic; however, it is by no means the clearest or foremost cause of such prejudices. Historically, systemic prejudice of the type you call ""racism"" has also happened against ""white people"" if they were peasants, laborers, Irish, Italian, Eastern European, Jewish, etc. depending on location and time period.

If we want to show solidarity with marginalized people, we should emphasize what we have in common, I think: the desire to live free of the machinations of people who would control or exploit us. This has little to do with phenotype, little to do with sexual orientation, and little to do with class. It has everything to do with freedom from those who would wield the organs of the state against any 


TL;DR: OP's concept of ""racism"" really needs some reflexivity. OP is not giving us the ""actual"" definition of ""racism,"" but offering a critique that unfortunately reifies the underpinnings of racism.",2018-06-26 19:35:29 UTC,1,0,/r/askgaybros/comments/8u27mu/does_racism_against_white_people_exist/e1c5jmt/

When religious people talk about familiar theological concepts, they (we) often forget that some common vocabulary and phrases have theological meanings that are not self-evident to people who are not familiar with that particular religion.  

When practicing Christians say that their religion is not a political ideology, a layman might better understand this phrase as **""Christianity does not specify the mechanics of the state.""**   There is no section in Luke that sets forth a tax code or a court system or a military structure.  This is distinct from most other religions of the time, especially Roman paganism, which was functionally indistinguishable from the secular government, and Jewish Law which was used to adjudicate both practical and religious issues.

This definition is very circumscribed. Christianity very much holds basic tenets that cannot be reconciled with governments that choose to oppose them.  In the extreme case that proves the rule, Christianity absolutely does not accept the concept that it might be illegal to be Christian.  When Jesus says to ""give unto Caesar what is due,"" he sets forth a very clear limit to Christian secularism, ""what is due"" not ""whatever Caesar feels like.""  

In point of fact, this is a ""political ideology"" by the dictionary definition of those words, and it very much calls for Christians to defend and sometimes impose their religious dogma on a political structure.  But it is unique among religious political ideology in that it calls for this sort of intervention only in cases when the State would otherwise threaten to contravene Christian religious beliefs, and stops short of prescribing the specific mechanics by which it would be acceptable for the State to act.  

Since most world governments today are largely secular, this construction of separation of Church and State may seem less meaningful or even incomplete. But it was a revolutionary concept in 2000 years ago and remains a distinguishing and cherished feature of Christian belief whose legacy is the modern separation of religion and government that exists today in historically Christian areas.",2018-06-26 19:33:43 UTC,1,0,/r/AskReddit/comments/8tzc11/what_passages_in_the_bible_might_one_day_be_used/e1c5evl/

[Lower Cognitive Ability Predicts Greater Prejudice Through Right-Wing Ideology and Low Intergroup Contact](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611421206)


Abstract:

Despite their important implications for interpersonal behaviors and relations, cognitive abilities have been largely ignored as explanations of prejudice. We proposed and tested mediation models in which **lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism)** and low levels of contact with out-groups. In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that **lower general intelligence (g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology**. A secondary analysis of a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of **poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact**. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive ability into prejudice models.",2018-06-26 19:32:03 UTC,1,0,/r/news/comments/8twf8q/chicago_bar_bans_make_america_great_again_hats/e1c5aky/

That's the sentiment that many feel about symbols in various cultures. 

In the black community, for example, the problem is that usually blacks are punished for their freedom of expression. You have to cut your dreads off to get a job, hip hop clothes are 'uncultured', big butts are ''gross''.

An Orthodox Jewish school censored bare wrists and ankles in its textbooks, Ofsted inspectors found as they downgraded it to ‚Äúinadequate‚Äù.

Teachers at Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls School in Hackney, east London also redacted passages from texts including Sherlock Holmes and a historical book titled Elizabethan England.

The state school, which has been put into special measures following a damning Ofsted report, blacked out paintings by Picasso and pictures where men and women appeared together.

Inspectors said that the redactions were ‚Äúdetrimental to pupils‚Äô learning‚Äù and meant they were disadvantaged compared to their peers at other schools.

 The school‚Äôs safeguarding record was also criticised, as helpline numbers ‚Äì meant for students seeking independent confidential advice - had been redacted from books.  Sex and relationship education was also not provided by the school, and most of the personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) lessons were taught through a religious curriculum, inspectors said.  

Yesodey Hatorah Senior Girls School, which educates girls from the ultra-Orthodox Charedi community in Stamford Hill, does not prepare pupils adequately for life in modern Britain, Ofsted found.  

Staff had ""systematically gone through every book to blank out any bare skin on ankles, wrists or necks"", inspectors said.

After inspecting the school in March, Ofsted found that: ‚ÄúGovernors and the principal have enforced a policy of redacting texts, which limits pupils‚Äô knowledge and understanding.

‚ÄúFor example, the majority of pictures in books on major artists such as Picasso had been blanked out. Photographs portraying men and women on the same page, for instance in a crowd, had been redacted.

‚ÄúParagraphs in English comprehension passages had been redacted. Whole chapters in some texts had been stuck together.

""For instance, in a text on Elizabethan England, leaders had redacted sections relating to the queen‚Äôs supremacy and the Puritan challenge.""

Theo Bibelman, the chair of governors at the school, has accused Ofsted of ‚Äúdownplaying‚Äù the school‚Äôs academic achievements showing a ‚Äúclear disrespect‚Äù for the Orthodox Jewish community.

 ‚ÄúThis report says more about Ofsted than it does about our school. Just a few months ago the Hackney Learning Trust, judged the school to be outstanding and praised us for many of the aspects now deemed by Ofsted to be below standard,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe were appalled at the way the Ofsted Inspectors treated our staff and students and we have made that clear to the relevant Government authorities.‚Äù

Mr Bibelman also claimed that Ofsted is pursuing a ‚Äúsecularist agenda‚Äù and is using ‚Äúunfettered powers to force faith schools to comply with their agenda or fail‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt seems that unless we agree with secularist agenda of Ofsted London then we cannot comply with their inspection criteria,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe are always striving to improve our school, and we continue to do so, but the nature of this inspection and the resulting report has led to us feeling part of a secularist plot.‚Äù",2018-06-26 19:29:43 UTC,1,0,/r/ukpolitics/comments/8u2c28/ultraorthodox_jewish_school_blacked_out_bare/e1c54hj/

Sin is pretty much defined as going against God's will.  If you're doing something God doesn't like, you're sinning.  Well, the serpent tempted Eve before she took a bite.  The serpent told her to disobey God.

So, you have to ask yourself, which scenario do you find more believable?  That it was God's will to send the serpent to tempt Eve, knowing full well that she was incapable of understanding the consequences of her actions (that knowledge only having been granted by eating of the tree of knowledge), or that the serpent was going behind God's back?  Because one means God set us up to fail from the start, and then punished us for failing a test we literally could not pass, or the other means something sinful was in the Garden affecting what happened there before the fruit was eaten.

Since the serpent was punished for it's actions, logically it was not doing God's will, and hence Man's fall must be the result of being corrupted by sin that was already present.  Man did not make the first sin, the serpent did.

> Also, I was taught that the snake represented Lucifer, who as an angel created sin by deciding to disobey God. 

Nowhere in the Bible does it state that the serpent was Lucifer.  In all versions it is presented purely as a snake.

> Speaking of Lucifer, I'm kinda curious as to where Christians have kinda deviated from the Bible on the subject of angels and demons in general.

That actually is an interesting topic.  If you go back to the oldest books of the Bible, namely ones like the book of Job, you find that the Devil is not evil.  Job specifically says the Devil goes up to Heaven and has a friendly chat with God, and that God and the Devil get into a running bet on whether or not Job is faithful because he's a good person, or just because God has given him lots of cool stuff.

Jewish tradition states there is no Devil, no Satan.  The role that the modern Devil is based on is actually more akin to lawyer or a test giver.  Someone who presents the situation to allow human free will to decide which course to take, but who is not themselves a corrupting influence.  It is only over time that Christianity morphs this idea into a prince of darkness who is at mortal odds against God, out to corrupt all of creation for himself.

Now, it gets really interesting here based on if you believe Satan to be evil or not.  If you believe that Satan is the source of all evil, the fact that he just pops on up to Heaven and has a friendly chit chat with God invalidates a core Christian belief.  That God cannot abide sin, and hence why Jesus Christ was needed as a sacrifice to forgive it.  Yet we clearly see in Job that God **CAN** abide sin, because he's having a nice Sunday brunch with the Devil himself.

Which then leads into further interesting questions.  Why was a sacrifice necessary?  If God wants to forgive sin, why doesn't he?  Why does God need to jump through all these hoops?  If he is all powerful, he can just forgive everyone and call it a day.  But if God is bound by RULES, then that begs the question, who made the rules?  And if there are rules that God himself cannot break, then clearly there is a power ABOVE God that enforces these rules.  Otherwise God is just being a dick.

We have evidence in the Dead Sea Scrolls that the divine name was already being treated with deference since the Psalm scroll from Cave 11 uses paleo-Hebrew script rather than Aramaic to write the tetragrammaton.

Yes and it's clear that both parties in America now believe that of each other, you can see that in the absolute unwillingness to ever compromise as well as the rhetoric on both sides.

There are lots of other smaller comparisons to be made. Most them have to do with extreme nationalism and the increasing credulity of the populace supporting Republicans manufactured with the out of control propaganda. 

This should not be understood to be a 1 to 1 comparison, or to say that I or other believe we are about to invade Poland and start gassing Jews. We should be worried about the warning signs we do see though, and I am quite concerned that we could easily slide into authoritarianism if the norms preventing it continue to be eroded and power continues to be consolidated by one side without a thought to maintaining a healthy democracy.

>I've found absolutely no benefits to disclosing publicly. It's hard enough for a woman to date while also avoiding the creepers and stalkers and Ted Bundys of the world - disclosing yourself to be trans to everyone before they even send a message to you just makes it a thousand times worse by throwing in the chasers and the people who hate trans folks enough to want to hurt them.

>I always give each guy I date a significant amount of vetting before I come out to him. In my opinion, my trans status is nothing more than a major medical condition - something you should know about your partner, but certainly not something you share within a couple hours of dating. Usually I try to make it a bit before we have the ""let's call each other boyfriend/girlfriend"" talk, and always before my pants come down (though I have given blowjobs to a few guys without telling them first - and later dated a couple of them). If at any point I feel that 1. He's not actively comfortable with trans folks (by this, I mean would be an active ally even without knowing and trans folks already), and with potentially dating trans folks specifically, or 2. He would not respect my privacy in keeping my trans status private, then he gets the ""I'm not really feeling this, we should stop seeing each other"" talk. Otherwise, I'll come out to him at some point and let him ask questions if he needs, and let him know that I want to keep seeing him and make things official, if he's up for that.

>I've stopped seeing around 10 guys with this method (not counting the boring single date flameouts) because I suspected it would end poorly. I've told 3 guys about my status because I trusted them. One decided to break up because he wanted bio-kids, the other two became LTRs, and all three of them are still fantastic friends with me. None of them have ever broken my trust by outing me to others. I chalk that up mostly to my level of caution and partly to my luck.

If a partner being trans is a dealbreaker for them, they're the ones who should be bringing it up and asking every partner they get with. As an analogy, imagine being Jewish and a guy you make out with gets threatening because he's an antisemite and *you* didn't tell him ahead of time - that's patently ridiculous, right?

Google has shown me this: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L0O96RlpIYk/Uk2KA2lecnI/AAAAAAAAAbs/Owuwtm-3zxU/s1600/Army+Combat+Shirts.jpg

It looks like something that is supposed to be used under the vest and is not very good without it. Specificly, a few show stoppers that I see: 

1. Lack of chest pockets.

2. Torso fabric looks significantly less durable if used without anything over it. 

3. Only half way improvement from the current uniform in camouflage aspect (torso lacks one). 

4. Tight on the torso, which makes it counter productive with the current efforts to increase draft among ultra-orthodox Jews.

5. Doesn't look like there is supposed to be lower layer under this shirt, which means that uniform budget will sky-rocket: instead of supplying soldier with 3 Bet uniforms and 10 cheep T-shirts, he will have to be supplied with 10 uniforms.

I'm sure that this shirt is the best thing in existence for the role it is designed for, but Bet uniform has a totally different role. It would be nice if the uniform would excel in some of its uses, but it is not required; what is absolutely must for Bet uniform, is to pass the minimal requirements of every single role existing in IDF.

> They don't cost all that much more than BDU tops

First of all, I bet that Israel is willing to spend on Bet uniform way less than US spends on BDU. Second, I'll go out on a limb and assume that you are talking about retail costs. However, the majority of retail cost is not manufacturing cost, but retail shop cost and distributor cost. Therefore it does not convey much information on what is the manufacturing cost. Given that for Bet uniform, we are talking about a multi-year contract to supply hundreds of thousands of uniforms per annum, we need to know the manufacturing cost.",2018-06-26 19:14:32 UTC,1,0,/r/Israel/comments/8tg8gr/idf_confirms_new_bet_uniform_details_in_comments/e1c41me/

AskHistorians,self.AskHistorians,duaneap,"Was there significant push back or resistance to Nazi Germany's hosting of the 1936 Olympics? Considering their openly hostile attitude and policies towards other races, was there significant boycotting or protesting by athletes or in other countries?",1,766126,Georgy_K_Zhukov,534219189,30555749159,"Yes, it was controversial, and there were protests and calls to boycott. In the lead up to the games - which had been awarded to Berlin prior to the NAzis taking over in '33 - there were concerns expressed at the international level, but the German organizers made minor concessions in a few places, such as including two 'token Jews' in the German contingent, and backed down from the most serious hurdle, the threat to prevent Jewish athletes from other countries from competing, which did have the potential to see the games taken away. Promises were also made that anti-Semitics rhetoric would be toned down, generally, for the period. This was enough to assuage the IOC and Germany kept the games. 

At the national level, in the US at least there continued to be opposition to participation, and some high-profile members of the athletic community called for a boycott as well as many labor organizations. But Avery Brundage, head of the American Olympic Committee, would have none of it, not only denying that there was discrimination against Jewish athletes in Germany, but engaging in anti-Semitic rhetoric himself (and he would join the IOC in '36, to boot). After the games, he would appear at a German-American Bund rally in late 1936, praising Germany and her hosting - unsurpassed in display of ""the Olympic spirit"" and dogwhistling those who had tried to keep the US out as a ""vociferous minority, highly organized and highly finance"", apparently a position which would survive the war, even, in 1971 calling the Berlin games ""the finest in modern history"" and *still* denigrating 'Jewish' agitation against them. Anyways though, with Brundage clearly in support of the games, it was unlikely America would skip them, and by early 1936, members of the Committee who had been against it found themselves being kicked out, mostly on quite specious pretexts.

Even this was somewhat far in terms of discussion at the national level. In Canada, while workers' groups and other Leftist organizations protested involvement, the Canadian Communist Party had been one of the more vocal, giving it little credence, and the Canadian Olympic Committee took little notice of it, themselves influenced by the British Olympic Committee, which had shown little concern either. The most notable opposition there, coming from the British Worker's Sports Association had resulted in a vote by the Amateur Athletics Association for a boycott that was defeated 200-8, essentially ending the matter there. 

But while the American Olympic Committee - and other national bodies - might have in the end decided to attend, that didn't mean of course that all athletes were willing to throw politics to the wind and go to Germany. As already touched on, from the very start, the most organized opposition had come from labor groups and Jewish organizations. As a result, there were several 'alternative Olympics' organized for the summer of 1936. In the United States, the World Labor Athletic Carnival was held in August, a two day event timed to occur on the last two days of the games in Berlin, and jointly organized by the Jewish Labor Committee and the Amateur Athletic Union. Additionally, less direct competition existed in the Worker Olympiad, which had been held before. In fact, two different versions existed, one run by the Second International, and the other by the Third International, but they had agreed to combine and host a single one jointly in 1937 in Antwerp, which while not a direct competition with the Olympics, a cooperation spurred by the rise of Nazi power.

The most prominent however, and the most direct challenge to the 'real' Olympics,was the People's Olympiad, which was planned to be held in Barcelona (which had lost its bid for the '36 games back in '31), and openly anti-Fascist in its character and billing. In the lead-up to the games, several additional sporting events were organized by the CCEP (Catalan Spots Committee), who had come up with the idea, and the COOP (Organization Committee for the Popular Olympiad), which they created to run the actual event. The first event, a soccer tournament held in April, was named after the German Communist Ernst Thaelmann, a quite obvious and pointed signal of what the aim of the group was. 

Delegations from 22 countries - and an 'Emigrant Jewish' team - sent roughly 6,000 athletes to Spain to compete, and 25,000 more people traveled to Barcelona to attend as spectators. Originally planned to start on July 22, so many athletes were attending that several more days were added, but somewhat ironically, the July 19th opening ceremonies never kicked off, as instead, since the day prior the city found itself awash in gunfire, with the opening salvos of the Spanish Civil War. Barcelona itself saw the rebels quickly defeated, and on July 21st the fighting was quieted down enough for the athletes who were still in the city to parade to the stadium, but that was the extent of the games. Most athletes left on the first available ship, although a few remained to become some of the first foreign volunteers in the conflict.

> Of course I can point to examples. You have Trump's travel ban, the lack of support for occupied Palestine, and much of Bush's foreign policy. But you gave yourself an out to say ""It's not Islamophobia, it's just that the geopolitical conditions make it such that we can't take people from X country.""

You realize that there might be some truth to that, right?

Trump's travel ban covers North Korea and Venezuela, which are not even close to being Muslim-majority nations.  In addition, it covers Syria, Iran, Chad, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia.

Only 1 of those countries is even in the top 10 globally for [total number of Muslim population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country), and only 3 are in the top 30.  If Trump's ban was really motivated by anti-Islamic sentiment, we would see a far greater percentage of countries at the top of that list, like Indonesia and India and Bangladesh, being banned as well.  So your claim does not hold up to scrutiny.

In addition, the lack of support for Palestine may come from the fact that *Palestine is the aggressor against Israel.*  5 separate times the Israelis have offered Palestine their own state, and 5 times the Palestinians have rejected it, because they do not want their own state.  Their stated goal is the genocide of every Jew in Israel.  I'm just going to link you to a [previous post I made detailing the evidence for this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/8nink1/free_palestine/dzwif8f/).  Once again, your claim does not hold up to scrutiny.

> No one was trying to set up their own Sharia Law legal system in Oklahoma. Come on. That's absurd.

Unless you read the Qu'ran and the Hadiths, which specifically say that every mosque is also a court of Islamic Sharia law, and should operate as such.

> Ironically, American Scientologists actually do have facilities that can ""reprogram"" members, often against their will.

Which is a bad thing when Scientologists do it, and a bad thing when Islamists do it.

> And just to be clear, there are religious arbitration courts where both parties consent to have civil matters judged according to religious law. These exist for all religions, and there seems to be no reason why they shouldn't, and especially no reason why they shouldn't exist for Islam in particular.

I'm pretty much against those in all cases.  Religious law is bullshit based on superstition.  The law of the land should apply to all people, no exceptions.

Up until now you're 100% correct...

> or boxed out with only the West Bank being a party to the deal. They have been keeping the quiet for the most part (with exceptions to the paying terrorists, and the lone attacks.)

...but here's where it all goes wrong.

Hamas is not keeping the quiet in Gaza; they're the ones who are responsible for the protests at the border, the attempted infiltrations, the tunnels into Israeli territory and the balloon and kite bombs. ""Exceptions to the paying terrorists""? They *are* the terrorists! Are you sure you're not thinking of Abbas?

Furthermore, Hamas is not limited to Gaza. They have a huge and dangerous presence in the West Bank; we've only this week foiled a West Bank-based plot of theirs.

More importantly, though, it is specifically Hamas that I am referring to when I said that our presence in the West Bank is the only thing standing between Abbas and assassination; not half a year goes by without it being revealed that we've foiled yet another Hamas plot to take him out.

So what are we supposed to do? There's no way any treaty we sign with Abbas would work. He has no power, he has no authority, he has no following; the man is so hated by his own people that he's in the eleventh year of his four-year term. Any self-respecting dictator would at least try to *fake* election results, but Abbas is so weak he can't even do that - which is why he doesn't dare hold one. If we sign a peace treaty and leave the West Bank, he won't last so much as a year before Hamas killed him and took over there too.

And that's under the assumption that Abbas is a partner for peace. Abbas has descended so far into the depths of anti-Semitism that even the New York Times editorial board has [given up on him](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/opinion/abbas-palestine-israel.html)!

There are some things you can say are supported by certain studies, sure you can say x chess grandmasters are jewish, but are they really? Depends on how you get your data. If you want it to be true that so many chess grandmasters are jewish, then you can manipulate that however you like. Guy has a relative from 150 years ago that has a name that sounds remotely jewish? Fuck it, add him to the list. From Russia and has certain facial features? Fuck it, add him to the list. The criteria to claim jewish heritage is extremely loose, lets be clear about that, it is somewhat of a race, or was, but has been extremely diluted and assimilated to the point where only mostly the ideology remains.It is not a conspiracy that many of the BEST LAWYERS, DOCTORS, POLITICIANS, JUDGES, SCIENTIST, ETC are jewish. 


Like I said, it doesn't really matter to me that much if it actually is true, its not like any of my world beliefs are remotely centered around that, and to be clear I'm not one of the tards here saying HH all the time. I don't have anything again jewish people, but I do think they have a poisonous ideology that can from time to time take advantage of the cohesion they have as a group and put forth some really shitty ideas and purvey some absolute lies. Its not a conspiracy, there is no organized anything making something like this get accepted as true, its just the ideology, do something that seems like it benefits the community, then it gets backed up heavily, and you better not say anything against it, even if you are jewish, or you are an anti-semite.


But when you have shitty data collection, with a group of people that reward each other for finding things out (or rather making it up) like this, and I mean seriously reward people (from all sorts of non-profits and foundations,) for doing these sorts of studies, then I think it is not very wise to take it at face value and just believe it.

""It is not a conspiracy that many of the BEST LAWYERS, DOCTORS, POLITICIANS, JUDGES, SCIENTIST, ETC are jewish.""

AskTrumpSupporters,self.AskTrumpSupporters,fsdaasdfasdfa,Is Trumpism falsifiable?,1,39727,Machattack96,533772711,30555647163,"‚ÄúWhy do they follow his every flip flop without issue?‚Äù This is a really important question. Why do people overlook Trump‚Äôs hypocrisy? This suggests to a lot of people that Trump doesn‚Äôt really represent anything other than winning and vengeance. Is that any way to run a country? Trump never apologizes- that might work for him politically, but is it *moral?* In the short term it makes some people feel good that a President never backs down, but will we all regret it when such mean spirited narcissism comes back to harm us by straining our relations with our allies? 

*He ripped up Hillary‚Äôs TPP!* Sure, that‚Äôs a loss for Hillary, but isn‚Äôt it a loss for all of us when it inflated our trade deficit, gives China an advantage to replace us economically and politically in the pacific, encourages the unfair trade practices we chide them for, and ultimately costs us more for the products we want?

The Supreme Court ruled today that the travel ban is constitutional. I happen to agree! But does that make it right? It‚Äôs a win for Trump, but isn‚Äôt the language he used on the campaign harmful? We‚Äôve seen both anecdotally and through recording statistics that violence and harassment against minorities, particularly Muslims and Latin Americans, has increased under Trump. That doesn‚Äôt mean his speech disparaging them is *illegal,* but it‚Äôs *wrong,* right? Even Jews are being persecuted more in America today than two years ago- white nationalists like Richard Spencer are empowered by Trump, whether you think he meant to do that or not. How do I know? *Because they say as much.*

The rules aren‚Äôt written into law because we tend to believe in universal rights. And I *really believe that.* You have the right to be racist, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you *are* right to be racist. It‚Äôs wrong whether it‚Äôs legal or not. And make no mistake, Trump‚Äôs remarks, again, regardless of whether intentionally or not, are often racist. At the minimum, they empower people like Richard Spencer and genuinely scare people like the Mexian man who was recently videotaped being berated by a woman calling him a rapist and saying ‚Äúeven the president‚Äù says so. He gives legitimacy to speech which we have for so long been trying to push into the shadows.

And that‚Äôs one of the central themes of Trump‚Äôs political career. The big ‚Äúrule‚Äù he breaks is not being politically correct. It‚Äôs being used by everyone now as an excuse to say things that you *shouldn‚Äôt say.* It‚Äôs not politically correct to say there were ‚Äúfine people on both sides‚Äù when one of those sides is a group we should all agree *cannot, by definition, be comprised of ‚Äúfine people.‚Äù* Everyone should agree that any member of Richard Spencer‚Äôs ‚ÄúNational Policy Institute,‚Äù in quotes to let anyone unaware know that this is his innocuous name for his white nationalist group, is not a ‚Äúfine person.‚Äù If he had said there were bad people on both sides, then ya, that‚Äôs true. But trying to waffle and say things just got out of hand hands legitimacy to the white nationalist movement- it implies that they have the same grounds that the counter protestors had. They had the same *rights,* but we cannot equate the validity of ‚Äúwhites are the superior race‚Äù with the message that ‚Äúall people are equal.‚Äù

The defining quality of the trump movement is hypocrisy. He accuses democrats of wanting open borders and literally says that they care more about other countries and their citizens than America and hers. But when it comes to statues of confederate generals, they‚Äôre ‚Äúpart of our history.‚Äù Make no mistake: every single confederate general was a traitor against the United States and fought on the wrong side of the War of *Southern* Aggression (southern because, despite the rhetoric of the lost cause, it was indeed *the south* which attacked *the north* first). And those confederate generals fought for a movement founded on the principle that black people were inferior to white people.

‚ÄúHe just comes in with the sword of a thousand truths.‚Äù No. He came in with a sword of a thousand let-me-tell-you-what-you-want-to-hears. He lies incessantly, so much that he‚Äôll lie about totally inconsequential facts (I would‚Äôve found any article on crowd sizes petty after Trump‚Äôs inauguration if he hadn‚Äôt brought it up first and lied about it). He says things a lot of people are afraid to say and want to hear. That doesn‚Äôt make them true. Things like the ‚Äúrecord crime‚Äù rates. That plays well to people who don‚Äôt know it isn‚Äôt true. He‚Äôs made an issue out of something that doesn‚Äôt exist! He blames congress for things he did, and then expects *praise* for his about face (for example, he said the law mandates child separations at the border, when it was Jeff sessions who deliberately changed DOJ‚Äôs interpretation of Title 8 U.S.C. 1325(a), which gives *discretion* to the executive branch and was not ‚Äúunenforced‚Äù by Obama and Bush).

And he‚Äôs made logical fallacies main stream. Whataboutism, ad hominem, straw man. If anyone in this thread cannot name an instance of Trump employing *each* of these tactics then they are among the blessed few not on Twitter. The ‚Äúrules‚Äù say you can‚Äôt use these. When I did debate in high school I constantly saw refutations centered around pointing out logical fallacies in opponents‚Äô arguments. Are high schoolers better informed on the nature of argumentation than Trump? I think so, but they‚Äôre certainly not as good at obfuscating the fact that they‚Äôre being used.

The norms exist for a reason. They don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake the game less fun‚Äù they make the game playable. Politics will only degrade further into a state of anarchy if we can‚Äôt all agree one certain rules and positions that everyone should agree on. There are tactics that should never be used, things that strain the constitution in pursuit of a policy goal.

I‚Äôve been saying that textbooks in the future will recall this time period as an era of Machiavellianism. Trump, and the right in general, is breaking the rules and it‚Äôs helping him get his policies in place. But the long term harms will be calamitous. When McConnell held up the supreme court‚Äôs seat he set a precedent for attacking the rights of a president solely because you disagree with him politically. What will happen if the democrats retake the senate in November and then soon after the next session of congress begins justice Kennedy leaves the court(either by dying or retiring)? Would they get revenge by holding up the seat until 2021? Could they do it? Should they? What if the democrats win bigly in November and then the day before inaugurations for senators Kennedy dies? Could McConnell stop them from being inaugurated to save the SCOTUS seat? Would the end of preserving a conservative court justify the means of keeping a political group from power? Is this an insane scenario, or is it reasonable given McConnell‚Äôs past assault on the constitution? Is the rule breaking just about norms, or will the law become as flimsy as our standards in order to preserve policy goals?

Breaking the rules can be fun and it really does stick it to those who are sticklers for playing ‚Äúthe right way.‚Äù But it gets boring fast, and in politics once it gets boring you‚Äôre left with the people who were paying attention from the start, not just when the rule breakers come along, trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild the norms that were shattered because the ‚Äúanti-elites‚Äù think they exist to oppress them and not to maintain a sense of decorum. And if it doesn‚Äôt get boring then everyone starts playing that way, and eventually the people who took advantage of everyone else‚Äôs trust in the system realize that their opponents can break the rules too, and all that winning they were going to ‚Äúget sick of‚Äù is taken away by people who knew the game better and finally sunk to the level of breaking the rules just to chalk up a win.",2018-06-26 18:40:28 UTC,1,0,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/8tslnr/is_trumpism_falsifiable/e1c1k8r/

Yes, that is true. But global distribution still protects against a single large-scale event, while a state makes it easier. 

>I don't think more than 90% of Jews would ever live in the Zionist state.

Well, the smaller the state is, the less likely it is to be able to protect itself, and the more extreme it must become in order to do so. A Jewish state that consisted of just 2 million people, for example, would probably have to put nearly its entire economy toward nuclear weapons and other military endeavors. 

>But I think Jews should have an alternative to assimilation, as assimilation isn't sufficient to protect you

This is fine. In fact I'd say that smaller communities of Jewish people existing within larger nations is a good thing. Those communities could use the countries they exist in as protection against genocides. If Jews are distributed throughout the U.S., Canada, Russia, the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, China, and other countries, they're pretty much immune to total extinction. Technically not *immune*, I suppose. But the only way for it to really happen would be to scorch the planet, in which case humanity as a whole is probably going exinct.

ShitWehraboosSay,self.ShitWehraboosSay,JaffiMeister,"Should Nazi symbols be ""censored"" in games?",1,17672,Phoenix_jz,534171717,30555631471,"The reality is, in order to market your game in many countries, you *have* to censor stuff. Simply by law, they're banned outside of education. Likewise, in Free-to-Play games such as World of Tanks/Warships/Warplanes or War Thunder, where you can actively pick different nationalities of ships... well, it doesn't exactly to well for your game's PR department if players are sailing around with massive (but historically accurate) Swastikas on the bow and stern of their ships - especially if you get legitimate neo-nazi's spouting their crap in the game.

That being said... in my personal opinion? Nah. Don't censor it. 

* Firstly, symbols only keep their power by how much reverence, even out of fear, we give them. In fact, that power is part of what makes so many people *like* it. It's taboo, is rebellious, and people like feeling dangerous, especially when they lack an identity of their own (Insert angsty teen here?). The Swastika, by itself, is not a bad symbol. It's actually an ancient, auspicious, positive symbol. However, when used by the Nazis, it is something very different. I'm sure I don't need to explain why it is such a terrible symbol. However, it remains such a powerful symbol because of how we fear and censor it, rather than allow it to be reclaimed by those it originally belong to.

* Secondly - It disguises reality. As others have mentioned here, it is likely that what's helped wehrabooism today is the fact that in games and media they have become so disassociated with Nazism and the SS, disguising reality. Perhaps if people more often saw their beloved Hugo Boss uniforms, Tigers, *Bismarck*, Me.262's and the like with blatantly flying Swastika's next to them, they would perhaps curb their enthusiasm.

* Thirdly - To be honest? Maybe I want to shoot the Nazis? I don't particularly care about seeing the symbol, because guess what? In a video game, I can shoot back. It puts me on equal footing, rather than making the Nazi's this aloof thing in the context of the game. Without trying to sound psychotic - what's wrong with a Battlefield mission (just as an example - I don't play the game/franchise) where you liberate a Death Camp and end up shooting a while bunch of SS guards, and their swastika armbands? And actually show off the consequences of those camps? I have a friend (irl), ironically Jewish, who's grandfather actually liberated a concentration camp during the war. It's some powerful stuff, even hearing the story secondhand. If teenagers in the 1940s were getting drafted or volunteered to go fight the Nazi's, then why can't I fight the Nazi's in the video games *about the same bloody war?* There were people who made the choice to fight, voluntarily, even against their own countrymen, because of the atrocities that they saw being committed by the Nazi's, the fascist regime in Italy, and Imperial Japan. So again, I ask. Why, in a video game about that war... why can't I fight them?
Otherwise, we might as well just play the games like they do in Chinese Servers - there's no sense of historical context, every nation  is a fictional one. World War, what world war? Who cares why it was fought, let's just have bullets and bombs and shells and rockets spray across the screen.

Judaism,self.Judaism,AutoModerator,"No Such Thing as a Silly Question - June 25, 2018",1,22619,carrboneous,533608095,30555627442,"They're more or less denominations, and yes there are others.

There's more detail in the sidebar (and Wikipedia), but here's the one line version:
* Orthodox is just that ‚Äî (ortho = straight/regular, dox = thought/belief). It's basic principle is that the Bible is the dictated word of God, the Rabbinic tradition is authentic and goes back to Moses, and traditions and practices established thousands of years ago remain fully in force and any potential alteration or novel interpretation can only be done in accordance with the explicit and implicit principles established by the early Rabbis.
* Reform emerged in mid nineteenth century as a response to political emancipation and advances in science at the time. Its views began by entirely rejecting the authenticity of the Biblical texts, the authority of Rabbinic tradition, and the obligatory nature of Jewish law (in fact, for a long time it was seen as inherently regressive), but wanting to retain the Jewish ""spirit"" (eg ethical principles). Because of its rejection of tradition, it is inherently more flexible and has evolved immensely multiple times over the past century or two, such that now it is incorporating more traditional aspects and encouraging (but still not demanding) adherence to some form of certain Biblical practices, with interpretation and application left up to each individual. One of its most important pillars is known as ""Tikkun Olam"", which is something along the lines of Social Justice.
* Conservative Judaism emerged from the conservative wing of the early Reform movement. It tries to walk a line between reforming Judaism to keep up with modernity and maintaining a fealty to Jewish Law (in principle) and the traditional ways. It has a committee of Rabbis who decide official policy decisions and make decisions based on scholarship in a similar style to Orthodox Rabbis (but in a way that is not acceptable to modern Orthodox Rabbis and does not conform to the tradition except very superficially). It does officially expect certain standards from its adherents, but is known for being lax in practice, much of the time (even the more committed members of the movement bemoan this state of affairs).
* There are other denominations (eg Humanistic and Reconstructionis) and sub-denominations (mostly in Orthodoxy, such as Modern Orthodoxy or Hasidism, but also in other movements, such as Traditional Reform, which paradoxically believes that their movement should involve less traditionalism). There's too much detail to go into there.

(Footnote: you may hear that Orthodox Judaism is as much an innovation as the other true, which is true in the technical sense that nobody called themselves Orthodox before anyone called themselves Reform. But in fact, the dogmas and practices of Orthodox Judaism go back thousands of years, only the term is new, and it originated as a derogatory term by reformers for those whom they saw as backwards and refusing to fall in line).

There is no central authority in Judaism. Orthodox Judaism maintains that there *should* be a synod of elders, but that the last one was disbanded about 1500 years ago and we lack the authority to resurrect it, but hopes to reinstitute it by some complex legal mechanisms when the Messiah comes, or perhaps sooner. Until then (and since then), each community and sub community has its own ruling authority, as well as relying on the authority of past sages captured in their writings. And a select few become world famous and everyone defers to them, but no one has absolute authority since the Talmud.
Conservative Judaism does have its central committee, which in its view is a legitimate continuation of the central synod, but it also voluntarily devolves the final say in almost all matters to communal Rabbis.
Reform Judaism likewise has a committee, but from what I understand it's more administrative than judicial, and even though they do sometimes rule on matters of law, by its very nature Reform Judaism is not legalistic and decisions about practice are left up to every individual (and thus even significant, movement-wide policies like who counts as a Jew can differ from congregation to congregation, despite their being an official policy in place, and I've never heard a Reform Jew say that they wouldn't follow some other Rabbis opinion just because it went against official policy).",2018-06-26 18:34:30 UTC,1,0,/r/Judaism/comments/8tp2n3/no_such_thing_as_a_silly_question_june_25_2018/e1c150y/

No I didn't. You realize that people can hate what trump does but do not think all of his supporters are nazis right? I can hate nazis but not want to label people who are undeserving of that label. You realize the concepts can go together right?


>2-You ask for facts
>3-When you get your facts your say that they aren't facts

Again proving you don't read what I was actually saying were not facts. I even pointed out two huge factors for being a nazi that you ignored and of course are still ignoring. 

You staying that I am a nazi supporting Republican is factually incorrect. I have never even implied I support those views and am a registered Democrat. But for some reason you want to insist against the facts of what I am actually saying.

>5-Then you list a website of nazi things and complain that I missed 2 parts of what makes a nazi.  

Right. Which is pretty big difference when you are trying to make the point that you are. You purposely left those factors out and refuse to consider them for some reason.

>6-You have demonstrated that you are a nazi.

No I have not. Please provide support or copy and paste where I have stated that I support and of these things what so ever. I just don't agree with the label of nazi. That is it. Everything else is just really stupid assumptions by you. 


>I'll go by what the Jewish folks that suffered in death camps said, thank you very much.  They have the experience, which is unfortunate.

And where did they say that all trump supporters are nazis?

what I really relate to here in speaking with believers/non-believers about the true nature of Jesus and what he truly taught is also when you bring up the covenants with even well-read theologians and pastors... many don't understand the implications.

So to cover it quickly, we have three major covenants that are acknowledged in the Bible. We have the first between Yahweh and 'Adam & Eve' in the Garden of Eden scenario, we have the second between 'Yahweh' and Abraham after The Fall, and then we have Jesus and his resurrection (reincarnation?) as the third.

What are the significance of these covenants? The first covenant seemed to hinge on the acquisition of certain knowledge - 'don't eat the fruit which happens to be called the Fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil (quite the title)'. Upon eating said fruit, the covenant was broken and we were cast out.

The second is an interesting one. After the fall from the Garden of Eden, it seems as if Yahweh pulls back its influence and we are left to fend for ourselves for a time. It's not until Abraham is asked to sacrifice his long-awaited son that we really see Yahweh return to the stage, but what's with the personality change? From helicopter parent to child trafficker, Yahweh goes hard in the other direction from its approach in the Garden, where harmony reigned supreme. 

Additionally, we have the creation of an elite group of people - the descendants of Abraham. 'You follow me, and i'll make you special'. Knowing what comes after (Jesus), does this sound like the 'word of God'?? and within that elite group we have even more elite group (the priest class) which claims to have exclusive access to a God which claims to be lord of all... These are all troubling characteristics of a supposed benevolent deity of any sort.

So that brings us to the 3rd covenant - what was it's purpose? Why did it need to come? Who did Jesus stand against? Jesus actually speaks about it pretty clearly in John 8 - he came to destroy the 2nd covenant and reestablish a connection with our true father - the 'original' Yahweh. Lucifer is called 'the Great Deceiver' for a reason - I believe the Old Testament 'Yahweh' is not actually the true Yahweh but instead an imposter who 'took the reigns' after the Fall from the Garden of Eden. And I think Jesus was the correction that came afterwards. 

Don't take this as a slag against the Old Testament either - I think the Jewish people really showed a lot of character despite dealing with a petty & jealous God, and they often showed that true light/spark of Yahweh in how they responded to things. Also, I think it explains why the Israellites were always falling away from God and towards the Pagan stuff as well - I think there was a certain disconnect with the 'second Yahweh (Lucifer)' and that is a big part why they couldn't stay faithful over time.

Anyways, always way too much to get into and explore and think about, and I just wanted to add a drop in the bucket as your post got me excited to read somebody who sees things somewhat similarly to the way I do also (I may be even further out in left field but that's okay haha)... I'll leave with my juiciest proof of the theory above: 

(Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees arguing about who each of their respective 'fathers' are)

>**John 8:44** -  You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father‚Äôs desires. He was a murderer from the beginning *(reference to sacrifice of Isaac)*, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies *(reference to his identity theft re: 'Yahweh')*.

I think that there's a strong case to be made for social safety nets, and that there are areas where governments handle things better than individuals can, etc.

I've basically had to go silent among some people I'd formerly chatted about politics with. The Trump derangement is strong (I think he's a fucking circus clown, but he's by no means the next Hitler... whereas having elected officials exhorting crowds of people to gather mobs together to harass and chase down people who work in the Trump administration is some scary brownshirt type shit) and taking on the timbre of a religion.

She claimed she had no intention of being a hero. From her perspective, it was as if the whole country was in a trance and walking off a cliff. People like her simply decided that they wouldn't go over the cliff.

Screenwriting,self.Screenwriting,SersenErzum,Help with some ideas for alternative symbolism,1,200432,MichaelG205,534051317,30555578960,">-the sunrise, of course, symbolises the beginning of a new day and
offers a chance to start over
-in japanese culture, Sakura (the cherry blossom) is a symbol of new beginnings and a fresh start. The season of cherry blossom corresponds  to the calendar and fiscal years in Japan. This marks the start of new  beginnings like a pupil's first day in school( the school year begins in April) Most new college graduates begin their new careers at this time of year.Therefore, for many people the sakura are also a symbol of starting a new chapter in life or of starting over with a renewed sense of hope and optimism.
-The Phoenix:The bird which dies by flame, rises anew in it's own ashes as rebirth. The symbol of nonstop rebirth and new beginnings.
-The Butterfly/Caterpillar :The ugly caterpillar enters the caccoon to emerge a beautiful butterfyl. Signifies change can bring about new beginnings and beauty.
-The snake:is revered worldwide. It's shown over and over again as a potent deity. The snake is associated with both negative and positive, or duality, even in Christianity.
 This creature has the ability to shed its old skin when it grows it. The casting off of this skin metaphorically, represents the release of old ways of thinking that don't work in our lives. The fresh new skin found underneath is rebirth and renewal...purification.
-The Ouroboros :An ancient Greek symbol, the ouroboros is usually depicted as a serpant consuming its own tail. The symbol hints at the cyclical nature of life and how we are constantly ""consuming"" and recreating ourselves. To get forward we must consume our past or we cannot move forward.
-Khepera or Khepri: in ancient Egypt , khepri is the scarab beetle who pushes the solar orb above the horizon at dawn. The scarab represents the morning sun and is closely associated with creation and resurrection. He 
serves planet Earth as a loyal guardian and spinner of cycles, bringing forth necessary changes that allow creation to keep moving forward.
-the Birch Tree is also a symbol of new beginnings in celtic symbolism:
The birch is highly adaptive and able to sustain harsh conditions with casual indifference. Proof of this adaptability is seen in its easy and eager ability to repopulate areas damaged by forest fires or clearings. the birch is a pioneer, taking root and starting anew to revive the landscape where no other would before.This is a powerful metaphor for renewal
-in the Bible, the number 8 represents rebirth and resurrection:Jesus' transfiguration was on the eighth day ( a man 'born again'  resurrected from the dead into eternal life).
Noah saved eight persons from the flood to start over.
The star of Bethlehem was usually shown with eight rays
The Jewish rite of circumcision which marks the beginning of the newborn boy‚Äôs relationship with God is performed on the eighth day.
-In the tarot, the Magician card is the first card of the Major Arcana (the more figurative part of the deck).The Magician is linked to the number one, to the beginning of each  activity, process and project. Depending on the associated cards  revealed during the fortune-telling reading, the Magician card can mean  adaptability, potential, transformation and ...new beginnings!
-The Egg/Baby/Seed :As the initial stage for any species or plant the egg/baby/seed represents the hope of a new beginning.
-The red robin and spring: robins are one of our first visual signs from the animal kingdom that thereturn of warmth is on its way.Not only is the robin a promise of new beginningswith the new cycle of spring in our midst, it carries symbolic meanings of cheer, joviality and light-heartedness.",2018-06-26 18:20:04 UTC,1,0,/r/Screenwriting/comments/8tykmt/help_with_some_ideas_for_alternative_symbolism/e1c03m8/

Zionism in common parlance is used to indicate a certain degree of loyalty to Israel. 

Dictionary.com defines it as 

>a worldwide Jewish movement that resulted in the establishment and development of the state of Israel.

Wikipedia defines it as 

>Zionism (Hebrew: ◊¶÷¥◊ô÷º◊ï÷π◊†◊ï÷º◊™‚Ä¨ Tsiyyonut [tÕ°sijoÃûÀànut] after Zion) is the national movement of the Jewish people that supports the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel (roughly corresponding to Canaan, the Holy Land, or the region of Palestine).[1][2][3][4] 

It goes on to say 

>A religious variety of Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity defined as adherence to religious Judaism, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies, and has advocated the return of Jews to Israel as a means for Jews to be a majority nation in their own state.[1] A variety of Zionism, called cultural Zionism, founded and represented most prominently by Ahad Ha'am, fostered a secular vision of a Jewish ""spiritual center"" in Israel. Unlike Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, Ahad Ha'am strived for Israel to be ""a Jewish state and not merely a state of Jews"".[11]

>
Advocates of Zionism view it as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of a persecuted people residing as minorities in a variety of nations to their ancestral homeland.[12][13][14] Critics of Zionism view it as a colonialist,[15] racist[16] and exceptionalist[17] ideology that led advocates to violence during Mandatory Palestine, followed by the exodus of Palestinians, and the subsequent denial of their right to return to property lost during the 1948 war.[18][19][20][21]


So your very narrow definition of Zionism is inadequate, and non academic as well as being low quality.

Catholicism,self.Catholicism,tttesting987,Nostra Aetate - Free to reject?,1,45340,valegrete,533561172,30555573786,"Part 2

>Again could you ask am I free to say that islam is a satanic religion?
 
Any religion (even sects of Christianity) could be Satanic in the above sense:
1.       If it objectively teaches things which contravene natural law
2.       When used to justify deplorable evils
3.       If a person knowingly/willfully rejects truth to follow something else
 
Muhammad might very well have ‚Äúworshipped Satan‚Äù in that sense if he made things up, or used his religion to achieve evil ends. If he suffered from delusions, his personal culpability is uncertain. A peaceful Muslim who has never known any other religion but sincerely seeks God and follows the law written on their heart, however, is hardly worshipping demons. For some reason you think this is impossible ‚Äì you think all Muslims are evil people. Even granting you that, it would only mean that they personally ‚Äúworship Satan‚Äù by virtue of their choices, not because they happen to be nominally Muslim or because ‚ÄúAllah is a demon‚Äù or anything else.
 
>i don't believe Satan only speaks falsehood completely, no one believes that. Satan occasionally says something true, and mixes the truth with lies.
 
No disagreement.
 
 
>Can i believe that it was authored by Satan or a demon (if i were a catholic). Not again saying i necessarily believe that, but if i were a catholic would NA or any church teaching prevent me from saying this?
 
In what sense? That Satan tempted Muhammad into straying from truth and putting himself and His opinions about God above that which had been preached to him or which he came to know by reason? That Satan was able to entice him into using religion as a pretext for political domination and all sorts of evils? That who Muhammad claimed was the Archangel Gabriel was actually a demon? Any of those would not be a matter of Catholic faith or morals.
 
I‚Äôm going to answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù but it‚Äôs irresponsible for you personally to do given what you think that ultimately means, since you don‚Äôt see a distinction between the founder and the follower‚Äôs intent.
 
>Would it prevent me from saying that the vast majority of who Allah is described as in the Quran coincides more with a demon or Satan?
 
Yes, it would prevent you. This is inaccurate for all the reasons listed above. Again, God is not Satan + Truth, or Demon X + Non-X Truth, as your theory would require.
 
Could i say it is appropriate to describe the character known as Allah in Islam to be far more similar to a demon who has falsely taken a couple of attributes of God as well?
 
No, that would be inappropriate. The object of sincere, honest worship is always God whether the individual fully understands Him or not. Worshipping Allah would only be Satanic in the context that someone decided to reject the truth of Christianity so that they could turn to something else.
 
you still haven't answered if a catholic who converts to islam, do they worship a false god or not. how did the israelites worship a false god then when they worshiped the golden calf? you said that worshiping a false god is when you turn away from the true god. i wont restate the question since i have around 3-4 times.
 
In an ontological sense, no. In a spiritual sense, yes. I‚Äôve made this clear over and over again. I‚Äôm not going to answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù because you‚Äôll jump from that to literal demons for some reason. You do not have a healthy understanding of Biblical or traditional teaching on this subject, and I mean that respectfully.
 
>st. john chrysostum said that the jews do not adore God because if you deny the son you deny the father. why doesn't this apply to muslims as well?
 
It applies to anyone who denies the revelation in Christ. The Jews Chrysostom spoke of were those which had deliberately rejected Jesus Christ, who attributed his miracles to demons, who thereby spurned God. It would *not* include every OT jew nor every post-NT Jew. Think about it ‚Äì the pre-Christian Jews possessed the same religious sources as those who rejected Christ: is the God of the OT a false God? Is he a demon? Absolutely not. Is God pleased by Jewish worship? To the extent that it‚Äôs authentic, yes. To the extent that an individual has rejected Christ, absolutely not. That is the difference ‚Äì not in the ontological referent of the belief.
 
>i guess i should really conclude you can't give an answer that would also deny your NA - i guess that makes sense.
 
The answers I give come from dogmatic sources as well as doctrinal ones. As a Catholic, I have to integrate all those things and use them to come to as authentic an understanding as I can.
 
>please. when i ask ""could i say this"" could you just say yes you could or no you couldn't please. these aren't rhetorical questions, i'm seriously asking straight questions.
 
I have given you yes and no answers but you have an obligation to read and understand the context.
 
>edit: again you still haven't mentioned why hindus don't worship the one true God, despite far more of them than jews also believe in one God. what is specific about pagan idolatry that prevents them from worshiping the one true God?
 
Hindus don‚Äôt profess a belief in the same type of deity that the Abrahamic religions do. You‚Äôre saying many Jewish people are bigger polytheists?
 
What about seasonal/earthly gods, some of whom are higher up and lower in a pantheon, who may or may not be eternal, who are usually limited in intelligence and beneficence, contains any reflection of truth? They deny God is one, eternal, existing before the universe, separate from the universe, separate from humans, etc. There may be rays of truth in their religion, and as much as they sincerely follow the law on their hearts they may please God in a natural sense, but none of their language of deity is indicative of anything we know to be true about God. Therefore only in a much less concrete way can we speak of the truth within those religions comparative to something like Islam or Zoroastrianism.
 
>but this is not really true, considering an honest follower of islam (a muslim) would pursue islam for those goals, since that is the goal of islam. the goal of islam is to follow the entity known as Allah and the man named Mohammed.
 
The goal is to follow God as well as they understand him. This process, if undertaken sincerely, represents a true effort of the will toward the natural end that God has placed within man‚Äôs heart. It ultimately forms an authentic search so long as the person does not explicitly reject Christianity. We can‚Äôt speak for certain about their salvation but we cannot say that every non-Christian individual worships demons or rejects God in absolute terms the way you wish to speak.",2018-06-26 18:18:34 UTC,1,0,/r/Catholicism/comments/8to2fo/nostra_aetate_free_to_reject/e1bzzmi/

I agree with your motivations behind zionism; jewish people have historically been treated horribly. However, I don't think a sovereign ethnostate is the best solution. 

Let's go back and look at WWII and the Holocaust. The majority of the victims were not just Jewish people; they were Jewish people in Germany, Poland, and surrounding areas. Poland lost *90 percent* of its Jewish population to the Holocaust; however the world's Jewish population was only reduced by a third. This indicates that the Jewish community as a whole was able to survive the Holocaust *because* it was distributed. Imagine if Poland had been a zionist state - that 90% reduction would have been a 90% reduction of the entire Jewish population. 

Furthermore, I think it would be even worse than that if it happened again in modern times. A zionist state would be fairly small on the world stage, both in terms of landmass and population. After checking some numbers, I think the best modern analogy would be North Korea. 

If some country decided to start turning the wheels of nazism again, it would be much easier for them to do so than it was in the 1940s. Back then, genocide involved massive state machinery, invasions, and war. Today, all it would take is a few nuclear weapons launched at the zionist state and the second Holocaust would be started and completed in a few hours. 

The only way for a zionist state to prevent that would be to also nuclearize, and then we'd have another cold war, and mutually assured destruction, which would also be really bad for the world. 

If instead, Jewish people distribute across the globe, they're inherently protected from genocides.  ",2018-06-26 18:17:16 UTC,1,0,/r/changemyview/comments/8u1vql/cmv_zionism_makes_sense_or_it_is_reasonable_and/e1bzw5n/

I agree it would be wrong to change that now in the midst of a crisis.

However, calling Trump a xenophobe for calling illegal aliens criminals is silly. They are criminals. They broke two country's laws; one for exiting and the other for entering, intentionally avoiding *due process* in doing so. It is not unreasonable to suggest that those who would ignore those laws would be likely to disregard other laws.

For every desperate family fleeing violence or oppression, there's a several dozen more (at least) that just want to live in a better country and don't want to or can't afford to do it the proper way.

I really don't see the evidence that Trump is bigoted toward Hispanics in general. Every quote I can think of that has made the news has a reasonable context. And if you suggest that the fact that he doesn't say more positive things about Hispanic immigrants is proof, that's nonsense as well. Why mention the people who aren't causing a problem? Trump just isn't the sort of person to preface every statement with ""Now I'm talking about everyone here; most are wonderful and amazing and look at all they do for our country. But we do have this tiny little problem."" He just says, ""That's a problem there. We need to fix it and fix it now.""

 And for the record, I'm not a conservative. I didn't even vote for Trump. I've been pleasantly surprised by his (mostly) moderate actions. The guy runs his mouth something awful but his policies and actions have been commendable. I'm just tired of moderate policies that *lean* right being declared fascist.

Non l'avevi mai posta questa domanda, hai voglia ad ""aspettare una risposta"".

Perch√© la Alexander Maersk stava aspettando il permesso di sbarcare, per l'appunto.

> e non 'accogliere'

Come ti ho gi√† spiegato, l'accoglienza √® automatica tramite lo Sprar. Che potrebbe benissimo smistarli a Pozzallo, [dove c'√® un hotspot](http://www.interno.gov.it/it/notizie/hotspot-pozzallo-autorita-diplomatiche-estere-interessate-sistema-accoglienza).

Gi√†, pensa un po' che strano, insisto perch√© tu provi le affermazioni che sostieni. Devo essere matto eh?

Ricapitolando:

- il Sindaco di Pozzallo non ha mai detto di non voler accogliere i migranti

- a Pozzallo non solo i migranti vengono accolti, ma c'√® addirittura un hotspot

Equality for everyone regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual preference, etc. - I agree with the concept, but you have to understand that means NO special treatment or preferential treatment of any kind. Equality is equal treatment. Diversity quotas disappear. Race-based scholarships disappear. Affirmative action disappears. Women have to register with Selective Services. Pride month disappears. Black History Month disappears. Either that, or the people who *aren't* celebrated for their race/sexuality/gender will be brought to the same level of celebration / recognition. If you want equality, you want equality. I don't think many people realize this.  

Something sketchy went on behind the scenes - Evidence? Where? If you're referring to Russia, there's been zero evidence provided. No matter how many times ""there's a lot of evidence"" is repeated, there's been literally none. Besides, the last time the government had a mountain of evidence showing that something sketchy went on behind the scenes, Hillary Clinton was completely ignored for working with the DNC to rig the Democratic primary.

Like let's take the example of IL-2 wings of prey, where the base game was censored with the classic ""X"" instead of the Swastika but you could go to the Gaijin website and download the patch that added the Swastika. Because people ragged on about it long enough.  
So who downloads the swastika patch? Invariably, the Werbs and the ""true historical buffs"". Thing about it is that you almost never see the swastikas, since you're mostly flying Allied planes that don't have the swastika. Tanks are too small below to see the swastika, planes with swastikas zoom by too quickly to make them out, then there's the rare occasion you play as a german pilot and there it is. A swastika you never look at in the heat of combat that might as well remain a black cross.  
  
Also, most games steer away from the war crimes thing because it increases ratings and decreases the audience size. Though that doesn't seem to have stopped many little kids from getting their hands on GTA, or COD.  
  
And on to COD, it's kinda brave of them to attempt to add in scenes of Nazi atrocities(some might say clumsily but I've not played the most recent one). On the subject, do they persist with the invincible tiger myth in the latest game?  
  
At the core of it, most players just want to jump in and shoot shit. Most people can't be bothered about the sides behind it.  
I think if games are going to give a sense of the truth behind such atrocities, they're going to need to show the Nazi side of things with some really uncomfortable sequences in their singleplayer campaigns.(maybe a mission where you're on a train guarding cargo and it reveals you're escorting jews to Auschwitz, executing ""partisans"", physically rounding up jews, etc.)

The_Donald,express.co.uk,Cant_Stop_Winning,MERKEL CAVES IN! Germany offers to scrap EU tariffs on US cars!!,1,622008,TumblingAthlete,533504070,30555522899,"The argument is one of cyclical consumption and production on a macro level. I am not at all convinced of the argument, especially at the irreversible damage to unique societies that amounts to crimes against humanity on a level that goes well beyond homicide, but that appears to be the self-serving argument of those who both invested in real estate to bail out Europe after the ""crisis"" and the bond holders who want to avoid fiscal implosion.

The largest irony of all of these pro-immigration, ""save the refugee"" retards is that they are just pawns being manipulated by the very elite and super rich and psychopathic global bond sharks that don't care about anything but money. 

What you are rightfully talking about being contradictory to you, welfare paid to illiterate foreign savages by a population that is already 50% slave to their socialist masters, misses though that more welfare and government expenditure by politicians that have been manipulated into a corner and desperate to do whatever they can to save their career and legacy is that they will be desperate to further take on debt through bonds. Enter the global bond gods, who are the real global puppet masters that make governments and politicians jump and do whatever they want. 

What the global elite have achieved by, e.g., manipulating feeble minded Merkel into grabbing the tiger of ""refugees"" by the tail, is that they have removed as man alternate options and freedom and liberty Germany had through surplus. If there is anything bond gods like less than self-determination, it's when their targets have choices. They are in essence no different than a loan shark that is always quick to offer an opportunity for their target to get themselves into ever trickier debts and situations that make them easy to manipulate and extort and even turn them into willing officers and enforcers and informants. This is a level of happening that only a very few people are even just aware of, let alone really have internalized what it all means.   

I don't disagree that it wasn't all planned, these are things that are opportunistic. It's not like the iraq invasion was for the purpose of destabilizing the middle east and taking the lid off pandora's box of islam ... but damn if they aren't going to take advantage of the opportunity for their own purposes to, e.g., drive up inflation of real assets by piling ever more people into smaller space, which allows the global investors that bailed out Germany during the bubble to recoup investments that have not been performing and also thereby bolstering Banks that are STILL carrying ""Bad bank"" bad debt. 

The aim is inflation to recoup losses and debt slavery when it all comes down to it.

I agree that Merkel not having children exacerbates things, but reality is too that just alone being a woman makes her vulnerable to imprudent and emotion based choices. The people who pushed the picture of the washed up kid  who's death is the responsibility of his parents and those who created the pull of crossing the Mediterranean, know very well that women and parents who would otherwise object to invasion by savages that will be taking their land and resources are susceptible to emotional pictures like that. It's the same ""communist"" MO that is being used right now with the immigration issue in the USA. The Time magazine cover being probably the best example. 

You knowI really wish I could recall who it was that said back in at least the early aughts that there was a brown wave coming that would invade the USA and Europe. I recall the statement because it struck me, but it makes me now think that there really may have been a large, long term conspiracy in all of this to some degree. 

You say it wasn't a planned event, but the fact that we know for certain that Soros (and others) linked organizations were actively distributing information on how to get to Europe and then how to apply for asylum and what benefits to demand and what to say to get them and how to cheat the system, all tells a far different story. Also in the USA; Vicente Fox is on record stating that what is going on in the southwest is a Reconquista (his wording) to take the southwest for Mexico by demographic invasion by those who are loyal to latin America, which will then be used to hijack democracy to further compound hispanic advances through politicians that push and advance hispanic advantages. 

This all sounds extremely planned and coordinated, or at the very least strategic with a common goal in mind. Is it just coincidence that it's only white regions of the planet that is overwhelmingly not white that are targeted? Where are the demands that white people be given power in Mexico? Africa? Muslim countries? No, they are only demands that all non-whites be allowed to invade, infest, infiltrate, and conquer white regions of the planet that make up a true minority on a planet that is overwhelmingly not white. Why is that?  I guess they think they can just LARP as white and then magic will happen? 

Think about that though, there are literally each more Indians in India and Chinese in China than there are non-hispanic white people on the whole rest of the planet, but somehow those few places are the ones that need to be infested with non-white savages that are conquering us right before our eyes. 

I can assure you one thing, a genocide is coming, one way or anther. It will either be whites in the final stage of the conquest of all white regions of the world and evisceration of everything they created and thereby sending humanity back into savagery, or non-whites  as whites try to carve out a place for themselves in their ancestral homelands that have been infested and overrun by non-whites in a desperate attempt to try to recover their culture and society destroyed by gullible, foolish, mentally deranged socialists that were hell bent on destroying themselves this time around.

In the book, she is critical of Israel and it's relationship with the US in the 1980s (as that's when the book was written).

Rabbi Daniel Alexander, the Rabbi of Charlottesville's only synagogue organized a meeting between 40 Jewish leaders and Cockburn where she answered any and all questions they had for her for 2 hours.

He gave the following quote to the New York Times: 

> I just think most folks who came to this meeting didn‚Äôt take the charge seriously to begin with, even folks who read her book, which is highly critical of Israel and the United States and the U.S.-Israel relationship at the time. To criticize Israel is not an expression of anti-Semitism.

Sherry Kraft, who attended the meeting said the following:

> None of us think she‚Äôs anti-Semitic, that‚Äôs not even an issue. It‚Äôs more where are you about Israel. There‚Äôs a lot of negativity toward Israel from the political left right now and people who call themselves progressive. And some of that anti-Israel sentiment crosses into anti-Semitism, but not in her case.

The book is 27 years old and Cockburn apologized for what she said was an unnecessarily inflammatory tone and no one came out of that meeting and told the NYT that were not satisfied with her answers

Libertarian,self.Libertarian,therightideas,A question for our 'anti-fascist' friends here..,1,226322,therightideas,533834263,30555521335,"> I hope it's not too reductionist for you, but basically, you've gone through considerable effort to provide evidence to support the idea that different races ""don't assimilate"", and that they don't share your values. That's incontrovertibly racist in my opinion.

I don't necessarily think they don't assimilate and its not all races. In small numbers Mexicans could assimilate perfectly well, if you select for the best individuals. east Asians assimilate perfectly well, so do Jews. 

You can't deny that they don't share the values of whites as this is simply a fact. If reality is racist, it says more about the usefulness of 'racist' than it does anything else. 

Is it racist to say that Muslims don't assimilate into Christian culture or that white Brits don't assimilate to Saudi culture? 

> And not because of ""facts"". Some of the facts you present are are quite valid. Others not so but a dissection would be irrelvant because it's not material facts that make your diatribe racially charged and derogatory. It's the presentation and argument they participate in, and the conclusions you're drawing. It may be a matter of objective fact that my wife has a vagina. If I loudly and loutishly describe it's countours at a dinner party in front of my drinking buddies, my presentation of a very objective set of facts is pretty sexist and deragotory.

Context is based on societal norms, something gravely offensive in one culture may be custom in another. I don't put much weight on cultural norms when discussing stats because its pointless. The way something comes across is irrelevant, especially when its been conditioned into people to see it in a certain way. I agree that there is a 'time and place', but I fail to see how it changes the objective facts. Off-topic slightly, but your hypothetical actions wouldn't be 'sexist' by any definition. Again, its this idea that any rude behaviour directed towards someone of an 'oppressed' class is inherently worse than if its directed towards a white man. If your wife were to make a joke about your penis at a dinner party it wouldn't be sexist, it would just be an out of place joke. I'd encourage you to drop emotional descriptors when discussing these subjects, it doesn't achieve anything useful. 

> Like your ""facts"" about race here, the context, implications, and the conclusions are deragotory and demeaning. The implication I'm drawing here is you don't want to live in a society with people of other races because they don't share your values, and a central premise of that belief seems to be necessarily based around that there values are fundamentally objectionable, or ""white"" values are objectively better. How is that not white supremacy?

You're reading too far into what I say. I personally don't mind living around other races, I just prefer a certain culture to be maintained.  If blacks, Asians, Mexicans want to live in that society, support low taxes, gun rights, freedom of speech, they are more than welcome.  My problem is when groups come in and change the fundamental makeup of a culture, you as a Libertarian obviously want a culture of liberty maintained. Now lets say you looked at the data and people with double jointed elbows consistently voted to remove those defining attributes, would it be wrong to say ""maybe I should live around more people without double jointed elbows""? I am not a Jew, I wouldn't want to live in a community that is based on Jewish principles, I am not a vegan, I don't want to live around people who are vegan. Personal preferences don't magically become worse when the group corresponds with the traditional races. 

If Mexicans acted exactly like whites I would have no problem with them. There are actually many types of white I wouldn't want to live with, hardcore lefties for example. My judgement is based on behaviour, not purely because they are white or brown or Asian. Its impractical and impossible to assess every single person living in a geographic area so you have to resort to stats. When the stats conclude ""your lifestyle is most present around these types of people"", I conclude that is who I want to live around. Now, you can go further and make even smaller distinctions, I would much rather live around NH Whites than those in California. Race isn't a definitive conclusion, its just one bit of data to help you along the way. Its basically just using population averages to approximate the most suitable environment. Its a confusing explanation which requires a lot of nuance, but I think my above explanation is the most concise I can give. For me, its not race its culture. For others this will be different, I can only speak for myself. Some people want to live around whites purely to sustain white genes, that isn't my goal, my goal is to find a suitable culture to sustain my ideas, it just happens to be that certain races on average value these ideas in varying amounts. I am not saying they are better or worse for this, I am just saying that its my preference to want a Libertarian society. Do you as a Libertarian uphold the ideas of Liberty as fundamentally better? If so, you agree with me.

> Since I'm sure you'll insist that's unfair, let me ask you a final question, in a last attempt at good faith. Much of your post here is focused specifically on Latino folks. I'd assume that your basis for characterizing Latino folks includes at least some personal experience (it would be pretty laughable if it didn't). So, think of the first five folks you know personally who have Mexican or South/Central American heritage. Now, imagine that you're in a classroom with those same folks, and you are presenting this comment to them, in powerpoint form. Including the detailed citations like you've listed like ""The Alternative Hypothesis"". How do you imagine you'll feel making that presentation? How do you imagine they will respond? Will they agree with my assessment that you're racist, and fascist? And finally, would it bother you if they did? And if so, why would that bother you? I live in the UK so Mexicans/Latino's are pretty rare. I personally don't know any. Personal experiences are irrelevant when you have large scale population data. In any other situation, personal anecdotes would be fallacious. 

Seeing as I am terrible at giving presentations it probably wouldn't go down too well. But that's just me being pedantic. I suspect it would go down badly, because most people have ingrained emotional responses to these topics, the same way that women might be emotional if I did a presentation showing the physical superiority of men. Their reaction doesn't matter. If I were to do a presentation saying that men were stronger than women, it says nothing about me as a person. I could treat women exceptionally well, I could be perfectly polite and give them all the same opportunities. People will jump to unfounded conclusions, it means nothing. 

How would you feel giving a presentation about taxes and state welfare being immoral in front of a group of democrats, do you think they'd jump to the conclusion that you hate the poor? Its the same situation, people making irrational emotional responses to things which they have been conditioned to see as bad. I am sure it would bother you, because you understand the nuance of your position, same for me on this subject.

I hope these last two comments have explained my position well and causes you to drop the racist label, because when you get down to it, I am a 'Libertarian ideals supremacist', not a racial nationalist. 

I actually think this has been a rather productive conversation, so thanks for that.

As far as universities shutting down free speech, that's a mischaracterization. Bigotry is not entitled to the same platform as non-hate speech. Of course you can't be prosecuted for it, but that's exactly as far as free speech rights go in terms of covering hate speech. The university and the student body have a free speech right to not allow bigots a platform to spread their rhetoric. As far as that relates to Ben Shapiro specifically, he's got a lot of good stuff to say about healthcare and as a fellow Jew, he's got an interesting perspective on religion. But his stance on transgenderism is regressive at best (don't even get me started on his baseless assertions about gender roles) and he clearly does not understand racism in America. To use one of his favorite put downs, two things can be true at the same time: he's a smart person who I believe honestly wants what's best for Americans, but on at least some issues, no, he is not entitled to a platform, because whether he means to or not, a lot of his rhetoric gives bigots intellectual cover for their dangerous ideology. But he's a culture warrior and his claim of his free speech being violated is him doing exactly what he hates about ""the left,"" namely playing the victim to win political points.

The first concentration camps - installed in 1933, the second year of the Nazi-regime - were improvised tent cities. They just held unwanted individuals that ""broke the law"" without ever breaking the law. It was meant as a form of punishment and deterrent. The real concentration camps came weeks after the unchallenged elections of 1936 - in year five of Hitler's reign. Or his second term, if you will.

So, be more patient and give Trump some time. Fascism needs room to breathe and develop - and, good god, enough people give it that by ignoring the reality.

Trump's schedule is perfectly on point. History rhymes sometimes, you know?

Or do you think voters of the NSDAP all wanted the holocaust when they cast their vote? No, they felt victimized, went their wrath against minorities and just wanted a solution to the jewish question, just like Trump-voters want a solution to the immigration-/muslim-question. The answer to that question got/gets more extreme over time. And with fewer and fewer domestic successes you'll see an attempt to have more foreign ones, as well.

Unless you have automatic voter registration and automatic ID cards sent out. We don‚Äôt do that because of fears of ‚Äúbig government‚Äù and so getting registered and getting an ID is more dependent on you. Registration time is when your identity is checked so when you actually vote you don‚Äôt need an ID. People claim that this could allow non citizens to vote but there are almost no documented cases of this ever happening. On the other hand there are millions of people who weren‚Äôt allowed to vote because they didn‚Äôt have the right ID. And those people were mostly young and minorities.

This goes the same with citizenship. Just like not everyone has an ID, not everyone has proof of citizenship on them at all times. Forcing immigrants to have their papers on them at all times is viewed as a pretty authoritarian policy by many Americans that seems quite similar to Jews having to wear a patch in Nazi Germany. In America you have certain rights to privacy and (supposedly as clearly these rights are being taken away now) you can‚Äôt just be stopped and asked to show your papers as that violates some of our most fundamental constitutional rights.",2018-06-26 18:00:36 UTC,1,0,/r/politics/comments/8t5cgq/harris_says_trump_guilty_of_crimes_against/e1byoxs/

You say killing people is bad and blame it all on Stalin, because he killed twenty million people.   I argue that deaths in the war were a much bigger issue than one genocide, and we should focus on the larger picture rather than attacking Stalin. 

Stalin didn't commit genocide , Hogdomor was a famine . King Leopold II committed a genocide , Hitler committed a genocide .  Stalin was a mass murderer , same as Churchill . 

\>  Look you can shout ""Muslims are trash"" at a group of Hindus as much as you want, but if they didn't dislike Muslims to begin with they aren't going to go around lynching people in mobs. Any sort of hateful speech only strengthens existing resentment. I definitely think that there are people out there inciting violence against Muslims. There are also people inciting violence against Christians, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs , and so on 

So appealing to the basest of instincts and stoking up fires as much as a populist leader needs  in order to keep his political position is all well and good because that resentment existed in people anyway ? 

\>  Would've been a valid point if she was blaming Yogi. But this is a matter where the centre has no power. Yogi is technically still independent although he is in the same party as Modi .

People blame the person at the top for their ills . At somebody's moment of grief you are quibbling about technicalities . 

\>  A party and a person are two very different things. Period. Modi can not represent the mentality of every BJP 'karyakarta'.  

That's a fallacious statement , He is a figurehead of a party  and as such all the achievements and failures of his party will be thrown at his feet . Has Modi done anything to stop the rot ? Has he stopped following any of the trolls who viciously attack anyone who has a dissenting opinion about him . Did he punish the MLA who draped Pehlu Khan's killer in tricolor after his death ? 

\>  In simple words, my point here is , 'play the ball, not the player'. You can't win a game of football by attacking the goalkeeper. Similarly, you can't end religious hatred by attacking one person .

The Allied powers  shouldn't have attacked Hitler .  If they wanted to safeguard Jews 80 years ago , they should have introspected on what gave rise to modern antisemitism all the way from Richard Mehr to David Wagner's explosive prose but shouldn't hold Hitler to account  for the wave of antisemitism Germany experenced under his rule as Fuehrer .

He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned. While in jail he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (""My Struggle""). After his release from prison in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.

By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority, and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. This led to former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuading President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans which gave him significant popular support.

Hitler sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people in Eastern Europe and his aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his long-time lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.

Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (sub-humans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constituted the deadliest conflict in human history.",2018-06-26 17:53:25 UTC,1,0,/comments/8tt1ht/hey_reddit_uamazonwebservices_here_a_lot_of/e1by6di/

Let‚Äôs get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.‚Äù 35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him.

36 So both of Lot‚Äôs daughters became pregnant by their father. 37 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab[a]; he is the father of the Moabites of today. 38 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi[b]; he is the father of the Ammonites[c] of today.  &nbsp;

IsraelPalestine,self.IsraelPalestine,rosinthebow2,Historical Precedent for Destroying a Nation-State,1,2387,FAREEQAWAL,534113723,30555473840," In 1948, it was clear to observers that Israeli forces had expelled Palestinians from their homes en masse. Israel's Censor Board [refused to allow Yitzhak Rabin](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/10/23/113922574.html?pageNumber=3) to publish his account of the expulsions of Palestinians from Lod and Ramle. For many years, Israeli government spokespersons claimed Palestinians had abandoned their homes in response to instructions from Arab leaders to clear out ahead of advancing Arab armies. There is no evidence there were any such instructions. These claims were challenged soon after by Erskine Childers who noted:  


>Examining every official Israeli statement about the Arab exodus, I was struck by the fact that no primary evidence of evacuation orders was ever produced. The charge, Israel claimed, was ""documented""; but where were the documents? There had allegedly been Arab radio broadcasts ordering the evacuation; but no dates, names of stations, or texts of messages were ever cited. In Israel in 1958, as a guest of the Foreign Office and therefore doubly hopeful of serious assistance, I asked to be shown the proofs, I was assured they existed, and was promised them. None had been offered when I left, but I was again assured. I asked to have the material sent on to me. I am still waiting.  
\-- Erskine Childers, [The Other Exodus](http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/12th-may-1961/8/the-other-exodus). The Spectator, 12 May, 1961.

Benny Morris [confirmed](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4283093?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that a contemporaneous IDF account of the Palestinian exodus:  


>'thoroughly undermines the traditional official Israeli ""explanation"" of a mass flight ordered or ""incited"" by the Arab leadership for political-strategic purposes.'

There is no record of either Arab radio stations (which were recorded/transcribed by the BBC) or Arab newspapers relaying any such call. There was extensive discussion and rumors about massacres by Israeli forces and this definitely [caused much of the flight](https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&lpg=PA450&ots=6NZk8cRmVr&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false). Various Palestinians [called](http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/survival-of-the-fittest-1.61345) for the evacuation of children, women and the elderly from villages. Many villagers evacuated to cities like Lod/Ramle from which they were expelled. In Nazareth the IDF officer in charge [refused to follow an order](https://books.google.com/books?id=wELzivMr_-cC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false) to expell all Palestinians.

Fear for their lives likely played a big role in the flight of many Palestinians, who fully expected to return to their homes when the violence died down. This fear was well founded, since indiscriminate violence by Israeli militia was extensive and included incidences of rape and murder. I'm going to discuss the evolving view of Benny Morris, whose ""Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem"" is very highly recommended and whose work (also with Avi Shlaim's) did much to change the Israeli/Western understanding of the conflict. Chomsky and many others had questioned Israeli hagiography of 1947/48, but Morris's book is the one that breached the dam of denial. Benny Morris in a [2004 interview](http://www.haaretz.com/survival-of-the-fittest-1.61345) in Haaretz with Ari Shavit:  


>**According to your new findings, how many cases of Israeli rape were there in 1948?**  
""About a dozen. In Acre four soldiers raped a girl and murdered her and her father. In Jaffa, soldiers of the Kiryati Brigade raped one girl and tried to rape several more. At Hunin, which is in the Galilee, two girls were raped and then murdered. There were one or two cases of rape at Tantura, south of Haifa. There was one case of rape at Qula, in the center of the country. At the village of Abu Shusha, near Kibbutz Gezer \[in the Ramle area\] there were four female prisoners, one of whom was raped a number of times. And there were other cases. Usually more than one soldier was involved. Usually there were one or two Palestinian girls. In a large proportion of the cases the event ended with murder. Because neither the victims nor the rapists liked to report these events, we have to assume that the dozen cases of rape that were reported, which I found, are not the whole story. They are just the tip of the iceberg.""**According to your findings, how many acts of Israeli massacre were perpetrated in 1948?**  
""Twenty-four. In some cases four or five people were executed, in others the numbers were 70, 80, 100. There was also a great deal of arbitrary killing. Two old men are spotted walking in a field ‚Äì they are shot. A woman is found in an abandoned village ‚Äì she is shot. There are cases such as the village of Dawayima \[in the Hebron region\], in which a column entered the village with all guns blazing and killed anything that moved.

To an extent, this is the nature of all war. The war of 1947/48 also needs to be understood in the context of numerous riots and pogroms between the two communities which had occured prior. The point here, is that people who try to paint the war of 1947/48 in heroic terms, are sweeping a lot under the rug. Morris's view today is that Ben-Gurion personally issued expulsion orders and was careful not to leave a record of them. But Morris also believes such expulsions were justified.  


>**Benny Morris, for decades you have been researching the dark side of Zionism. You are an expert on the atrocities of 1948. In the end, do you in effect justify all this? Are you an advocate of the transfer of 1948?**""There is no justification for acts of rape. There is no justification for acts of massacre. Those are war crimes. But in certain conditions, expulsion is not a war crime. I don‚Äôt think that the expulsions of 1948 were war crimes. You can‚Äôt make an omelet without breaking eggs. You have to dirty your hands.""

Morris goes on in the interview to say he thinks Ben-Gurion made a mistake and should have ""cleansed"" the country of all Palestinians:  


>""If Ben-Gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleansed the whole country ‚Äì the whole Land of Israel, as far as the Jordan River. It may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake. If he had carried out a full expulsion ‚Äì rather than a partial one ‚Äì he would have stabilized the State of Israel for generations.""

Part of the reason Ben-Gurion could not ""cleanse"" the whole country was the presence of Jordanian troops in the West Bank who repelled offensives by Israeli forces. Avi Shlaim believes a [tacit agreement](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ssfc0005/The%20Debate%20About%201948.html) existed between Ben-Gurion and the Hashemite dynasty in Jordan which ceded the West Bank to Jordan. This (along with the [promise of monetary aid](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/07/12/88121047.html?pageNumber=1) from Britain) kept the Jordanian forces (which were formidable), out of the conflict.

Morris used some particularly incendiary rhetoric in the 2004 interview, saying Palestinian society was like a ""serial killer"" who should be locked up in a cage"". He [walked back](http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/benny-morris-on-why-he-s-written-his-last-word-on-the-israel-arab-conflict-1.465869) some of this rhetoric in 2009 saying he was affected by the suicide attacks in the early 2000s. I find it curious that Morris gives himself a pass for using such words when faced with the murder of hundreds of Israelis by suicide bombers, but his magnanimity doesn't extend to Palestinians who may use inflammatory rhetoric. After all, they've faced the deaths of hundreds of children and thousands of civilians over decades, not to mention the loss of their homes, lands and continued abrogation of their rights to free movement and self-determination. In any event, this observation should lead us to pay closer attention to the actions of the parties involved, and less to their words.

There are hundreds of examples of italians in the past or other nationalities holding events to back politics outside of the country. have you taken a look? or do you only know things that are spoon fed to you?

I've said this before, there's a difference between calling another leader your true leader and denying the nation you live in and simply attending activist events. It's not good for integration *at* *all* if people behave like the citizens of another nation while living in a different host country.

>b/c ethno centric germans are dont see these people as part of their volk. your failure to recognize the exclusionary nature of the german outlook will see the same result over and over again. and these accusations of treason is just disgusting, and shows your nature purely. Ahmet has to whitewash himself in han's image for hans to be accept... [etc. etc.]. 

Where are you getting these ideas from? It's like a perverted sense of how Germany works from the lens of a propaganda film. Have you ever talked to *real* Turkish Germans who aren't just angry people on the internet? They have fully integrated, look no different from regular ethnogermans, and there is no issue for them living as normal people in society. I'm friends with literally dozens of Turkish Germans who vehemently deny this picture of a Nazi like society you're painting. I'm texting a group chat of my Turkish German friends and they say this is an over exaggerated and generalized view of a very complex situation. Yes there are issues with integration and racism, but the government is literally doing everything it possibly can and things for these people are far better than what it's like at home. Also, LOL at this whole Hans and Ahmet story you made, points for creativity, but its super corny considering its nothing like that.

>Eating Doner Kebab made by immigrants isnt respect. its more complicated than that.

D√∂ner is great but I don't see what that has to do with anything... I'm talking about the free language courses given by the Job Center, the cash stipends, occupational support, and cultural centers. Turks do not and SHOULD NOT have a problem with integration, there is a problem for new Syrian immigrants, sure, but Turks have political representation, civil rights, occupational support, etc. Even with Syrians they get many of the same benefits and have huge representation in places like Sonnenallee. Turks don't get thrown into ghettoes, they choose to live together and bunch up for their communities, they have options to relocate to other parts of the city but choose to buy properties in traditional areas like Neukolln and Mitte. 

>germany only started giving citizenship in the 90s, before that there were turks born in germany, with no german citizenship. so if one is born there and not seen as a citizen how could he see himself as german? you think cultural outlook changes in 20 years. the turks have been in germans a long time before the 90s.

The system has changed. Whining about the 90's serves no one any good, we could sit and argue about the past all day and prove each other wrong. What matters is that today Germany has made the right decisions and Turks are treated incredibly well by the state.

>I speak to turks and their situations, they see the media portrayals of them around them, they see how that party in bavaria uses rhetoric or how the AFD uses rhetoric, and though the AFD isnt in the majority... [etc. etc.]

Lol what do you go around talking random angry Turks on reddit about how they feel? Of course there are more angrier elements of society on the internet. In real life things are way different. AFD is bad and their belief systems are spreading, but populism in general is spreading. The German government has to fight it and the society is already doing its best. You should see how large the AFD counter protests are in Berlin, you really don't know how many Germans are willing to fight them at any cost to protect the minorities. 

>Who to get rid of those ghettos in berin(you think you have done them a favor by leaving them there, this is mistaken thinking, he sees it as no practical way to leave that improvised area), make it easier for them to find housing right next to their german neighbors(the entire german outlook is wrong, these were supposed to just be ""temporary workers"" so no attempts by german society to engage with them in any meaningful way was made, and this went on for decades, where generations lived secluded in ghettos with no way out) and places outside of the workplace where they can interact together, maybe germans should visit more mosques and diyanet centers to get to know their turkish friends, instead of only meeting them in settings geared towards their own liking like a bar where they drink and eat swine, this is normal, but perhaps Ahmet has difficulty in socializing in this manor. maybe go to where he goes to socializes and talk to him, about things.

I don't know if you're a native English speaker or not but I had some trouble with the first sentence. Who to get rid of what? Are you saying the ghettoes should be forcefully eliminated? People choose to live in Turkish corners because they want to, all the Halal markets and restaurants are there and they like being near each other. Unless you want to depopulate the entire city and make everyone Turkish, theres no way you can force these people to leave. If someone wants to leave he can, it's not incredibly hard but with the state of the economy purchasing property in general is difficult. Any new immigrant will want the cheapest land while the native population who have lived there for a lot longer will be in different parts. The German government might be able to change this but definitely not now, cities like Berlin are already bankrupt due to all their social programs and Bayern is already supporting them too much. We have to wait until we see certain changes. Also, your last few sentences about Ahmet and him having trouble to socialize is exactly what tips me off about you never setting foot on German soil. You really think young Turkish Germans are just sitting in Mosques all day and afraid to socialize in different settings? LOL. Turkish Germans hang out at the same place as other nationalities, I've seen a bar with Turks, Vietnamese, Syrians, Somalis, and Americans all hanging out every week. Berlin is one of the most diverse cities in Europe and Turkish Germans aren't some innocent pure Muslims that only hang out at the Mosque like you incorrectly think. They go to the same clubs as everyone else, have their own hookah lounges where people of any ethnicity hang out, and everyone hangs out with everyone. This weird concept of ""Hans"" and ""Ahmet"" doesn't exist. If it does, its just some awkward immigrant who's not used to the culture yet, and still people are nice to him because they've been there before. 

>they choose germany b/c there is a german community already there, from back when Han's Grandfather needed cheap labor and hired Ahmet's grandfather to work for him to do jobs he wasnt willing to do.
you just dont get it, do you. there is a reason why europe struggles this such things that the US and Canada find so easy. forget turks and muslims. Why is it that the Roma find it easier in the US and Canada than Europe?

First of all, no one is forcing native Turks to leave Turkey and go to Germany. They don't have to leave at all. And if they do, they have an entire system put in place that gives them gainful employment, cash stipends, civil rights, and opportunity to integrate. It's a no lose situation. Why complain lmao. Also, the fact that you compare Europeans and Romas to the immigration culture in America and Canada is hilarious. You do realize that America and Canada have been accepting millions of immigrants for hundreds of years? You don't think thats probably a reason why immigrating is easier there? European nations were all homogenous up until a few decades ago, I'm not surprised if some elements of their society have issues with adapting. I'm just glad they have adapted and are implementing processes to help out immigrants. Germany really is the best nation to immigrate to, the fact that you still find faults is wild.

I think that's a key part of your misunderstanding. The state of Israel was not created by the UN. The area which now contains Israel, Gaza and the West bank was administered by the British after the end of WWI. After WWII the British stated that they were no longer interested in taking responsibility for the area and that they would withdraw.

As /u/Custy_Irishman says, there was a lot of ongoing violence between the Jews and the Arabs over this period. Diplomatic attempts to draw up borders and divide the land failed. There was a UN plan and resolution to partition the area into Jewish and Arab states, but this plan was not accepted by the Arab population of the area.

In the face of escalating violence by the Arabs and with the British already withdrawing the Israelis declared independence on May 14th 1948.

The continuing violence arises because immediately following the declaration the Arabs together with forces from Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq attacked the new state. The Arabs lost. Badly. The Israelis took control of large parts of Palestine that were not at the start Jewish controlled. The Palestinians living in those areas were (mostly) expelled. So the Palestinians hate the Jews for taking the land in 1948. The Jews dislike the Palestinians for attacking them in 1948 and all the terrorist attacks since.",2018-06-26 17:41:03 UTC,1,0,/r/history/comments/8txp1n/why_is_the_recognition_of_israel_in_1948_by_the/e1bxap4/

Wicca,self.Wicca,Church-of-Nephalus,How to tell what god/goddess/pantheon is right for me?,1,25992,kaci3po,534122046,30555440287,"Unless you personally want to, out belong to a tradition that dictates otherwise, you don't _have_ to stock with one pantheon.

That said, those animals have associations with many deities in different pantheons, but my mind goes immediately to the Celts and the Norse.

Also, and this is just my opinion, but I don't think we have to wait for a god or goddess to ""call"" to us, necessarily. I think some deities do call people, but not everyone who ends up in their worship. For instance, I was a happily practicing reform Jew until Artemis grabbed me one day and said ""nuh-uh"". She stuck around long enough for me to start worshipping the Greek pantheon as a whole and then basically walked away. She ""called"" to me long enough to get me on the right path and then was done. 

Conversely, I spent a very long time being obsessed with Brigid, reading everything about her, following blogs about her, reading people's accounts of interacting with her... But I never felt a call so I kept not actually engaging with her. One day I broke down and left her an offering and she was like ""finally, took you long enough"". But there has never been a call. My intense interest _was_ the call.

So I always try to remind people that a ""call"" is not everything and just because you don't think there is one doesn't necessarily mean you're not wanted. It's a trial and error process but very worth it when you finally get it right. ",2018-06-26 17:38:43 UTC,1,0,/r/Wicca/comments/8u037i/how_to_tell_what_godgoddesspantheon_is_right_for/e1bx4m7/

Jesus' main argument is about hypocrisy, that the priesthood is enforcing a bunch of laws and punishing people for breaking them, but they ignore those laws completely and only make a show of being faithful to God.

The Pharisees, the existing Jewish power structure at the time, who hated Jesus, questioned him repeatedly about Jewish law, he's asked to tell them the most important of the commandments and Jesus says to love God and to love man, that all the laws are the basis of this.

Part of Jesus' mission is to point out that God is for everyone, not just the Jews, and that a lot of what you're told to do is not what God actually wants people to do. The Samaritans were hated at the time, they where enemies of the Jews.

Ti rispondo subito: perch√© a nessuno piacciono le vittime. Nemmeno alla ""balena"" che tu citi. A nessuno piace chi si frigna addosso e d√† sempre la colpa agli altri per le proprie sfortune/insuccessi.

Inoltre che le donne conservatrici(che non significa misogine, mind you, sono due parole diverse pr una ragione)esistono √® la scoperta dell'acqua calda. Io sono ho delle idee conservatrici, mi voglio sposare, sono ""contro"" il sesso occasionale(per me stessa, non ci faccio le crociate) e credo nelle relazioni stabili e durature. Se vogliamo mettici pure che mi sento a disagio con vestiti poco coprenti. Mi piace pure cucinare e ho l'ossessione della pulizia. Non sono nemmeno di sinistra, sono liberista. 
Per√≤... studio fisica, gioco ai videogiochi tutto il tempo, viaggio molto, ho una passione per i film di guerra. 

Quello che voglio dire con sto pippone sulla mia vita personale √® che le persone sono complesse. Se non sei in grado di cogliere la complessit√† delle persone √® colpa tua. Inoltre √® abbastanza stupido giudicare qualcuno in base all'attivit√† politica o al profilo social.

Fra l'altro molte ragazze controllano i profili social di chi stanno vedendo. Se il tuo profilo Facebook √® pieno di stati sulle donne che fanno sembrare quelli dell'ISIS dei femministi radicali nessuno ti vorr√† mai. Ed √® giusto cos√¨.

Perch√© voi incel non volete una ragazza, volete un cane. Volete un cane che vi scodinzoli indipendentemente dalle stronzate che vi inventate o da quello che fate. Volete una modella che sorride tutto il tempo, che vi dia sesso 3 volte al giorno senza avere niente in cambio, volete che non vi contraddica mai e che non abbia una vita all'infuori di voi. Ma non solo volete la modella che dicevo prima, la volete perfetta, taglia 38 se no √® una chiattona, con le tette enormi, bellissima senza trucco perch√© ""il trucco √® mentire"". Volete che ogni donna minimamente attraente vi dia attenzioni perch√© siete womini e sono obbligate a fare sesso con voi quando volete voi e come volete voi. E sia mai fare un regalo a qualcuno.

Ho una brutta notizia: queste cose esistono solo nella vostra testa. Suscitano ilarit√† in pressoch√© chiunque perch√© n√© il sesso n√© le relazioni funzionano in questa maniera, indipendentemente da quelle che vanno con i criminali, le donne antifemministe o gli altri strawman che tirate convenientemente fuori. Esistono donne antifemministe? S√¨, e quindi? Non sono obbligate a darvela comunque.

Le relazioni funzionano a doppio senso. Meritano di essere vissute se e solo se entrambi lo vogliono, non perch√© qualcuno sta con te per piet√† o perch√© le hai fracassato cos√¨ tanto i coglioni che te l'ha data per sfinimento. Il sesso e l'amore non sono diritti, sono cose che vanno guadagnate tramite rispetto e fiducia reciproca. Vale anche per il sesso occasionale fra l'altro.

Se per√≤ parti con il presupposto che sei vittima di un gombloddo, che il dirti di no √® bullismo, che sono tutte stronze perch√© buh nessuna me la da, allora non arriverai mai da nessuna parte. Perch√© non c'√® nessun gombloddo o discriminazione, ti sei costruito una prigione su misura a tuo uso e consumo nella tua testa e vuoi continuare a raccontartela.

The rules help us followers to progress to the ‚Äúnext level‚Äù so to speak - originally, the Jews were allowed to enact fair retribution - specifically, they could demand *equal* restitution for crimes committed against them (its eye for eye, not two eyes, an arm, and your left foot for an eye).

>14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

Jesus tells us that those who do not believe in Him will not go where He goes-to heaven.

John 8

>21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

>22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.

>23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

>24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

Hell is described as the **end** for those who deny Christ. Hell cannot be their end and heaven be their end at the same time.

Matthew 13

>24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

>25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.

>26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

>27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?

>28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

>29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.

>30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

---
>36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.

>37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;

>38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

>39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

>40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.

Libertarian,self.Libertarian,therightideas,A question for our 'anti-fascist' friends here..,1,226322,therightideas,533834263,30555393766,"> My personal politics are centered around the idea of individualism, as is so for most libertarians. To me, natural rights, individual and inalienable, are the cornerstone of libertarianism. Terms like ""Homogeneity"", ""social cohesion"", and ""collectivise"" sound wretchedly authoritarian to me, and an affront to those rights. Natural rights include the right to liberty, which I take to mean the right for individuals to be free to the extent that they do not impinge on the liberty of others. In my opinion a society that is homogenous, in any useful sense of the word, will not be a free socety. Any state effort to ensure we're homogenous is going to involve a shit ton of violence and horror.

I agree, that's why I don't think it should be the states job. Although, in the modern world we do have lots of homogeneous societies that are very well developed and incredibly peaceful, Japan, Switzerland, Finland, Denmark etc. We see violence in Israel but that is for different reasons, its kind of an example of why sometimes separation is desirable for people. 

Just to be clear, I don't mean homogeneous in terms of politics or ideology, that is impossible to achieve and not desirable. 

I know it might 'feel' bad, buts not a valid argument. We've all been bought up to see multiculturalism and 'diversity' as great goals to strive towards, hearing the opposite is going to sound bad until you get past those barriers in your mind. From childhood you are pretty much discouraged from ever discussing race, apart from racism, so its understandable that people get touchy when its bought up. Its like the world 'cunt', people think its a horrible word compared to 'fuck', but why? Because they've been conditioned to believe it. Once you realise that you can discuss these things without wanting to gas the Jews or insight genocide, it doesn't seem bad at all. Its like leftists and taxes, people have an ingrained emotional response to 'taxation is theft' and it takes some effort to brake those associations of taxes = community/sharing. Bad feelings often aren't rational responses. 

So you have to understand, when I cited stats about Hispanics I am not seeing them as less than human or anything, I am looking at it from a purely statistical sense. Its like gun control, a Libertarian will look at it and ignore the emotional aspect of kids dying, that is why it looks bad when we say ""statistically its not a big problem"", its the same thing with race, it seems callous to discuss it to an outside viewer. 

> We the fruits of such kind of labor right now in Trump's kids concentration camps.

I am not trying to be rude, but I think you're buying into emotional manipulation from the left. 

12'000 kids are in the government care, 10'000 of them crossed alone. 

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/20/donald-trump-says-will-sign-executive-order-end-child-separation/

Now, lets look at this analytically. You have 10'000 unidentified kids crossing illegally into your country from a foreign country. What do you do with them? They have no parents with them so you can't leave them with the parent, they are kids so you can't let them go free. Are we mean't to deport them alone?

Now, for other 2000. They have crossed the border illegally with adults, who we cannot be sure are even their parents. When I crossed to another country as a kid, they would check my parents were my legally guardians, this is how borders function. Its dangerous to allow unidentified people to carry unidentified kids across the border. With the case of the Time magazine girl, she was taken from her Dad by the mother and essentially smuggled across the border without his consent. 

So the logical thing to do is to hold them separately from these strangers until it can be verified they are related. You can't pick up a child from school without being verified, so why should you be able to smuggle one illegally across the border?

Its not a race issue, its a matter of actions. They are doing it illegally and irresponsibly. If they entered legally like everyone else there would be no problems. 

> Furthermore, your full comment here, to me, reads rather blatantly like a giant argument for ethnonationlism (which, I would regard as by definition both facist and racist.) You've instisted in comments elsewhere that you've found these characterizations unfair. Candidly though, your entire comment here still seems like a giant manifesto for white nationalism. I'm trying my best to be charitable, but I can't see a distinction between what you are advocating for in the comment above and the dictionary definition of white nationalism.

Again, I come back to this emotional association point. You seem to be associating 'white nationalism' with violent skinheads and racists. Like I said, ethno-states basically already exist in Europe and Japan, not enforced by violence or racism. 

The definition of white nationalism is 

""White nationalism is a type of nationalism or pan-nationalism which holds the belief that white people are a race and seeks to develop and maintain a white national identity""

Lets change up the language here, white nationalism = ""a country for white people with a European identity"". 

Would you have the same negative reaction to ""A country for the Japanese, with an Asian identity"" or ""A country for the Jews, with a Jewish identity""

If so, I admire your consistency. But most people aren't. They don't see these as bad things for 'others', they accept that people want a place where there heritage and culture is preserved, but see it as a negative for whites. 

Would Japan still be Japan if it became 60% Mexican? Would Israel still be the same place without the Jews? I am not denying that you can have people of different races in a country, I don't see the need for a racially 'pure' nation or anything. To me an ethnostate would be like 90+% the dominant race, with the rest being made up of high skilled from the other races. Which like I said, is already the case in many nations, some of which are highly ranked in the world and are incredibly peaceful places. Even the 'homeland' of Libertarianism (New Hampshire) is pretty much an ethnostate. Its like 95% white or something, that isn't enforced through racial violence, it just naturally happens. 

You don't think of these places this way, but they are. 

I kind of strayed from the question, so I'll get back to it. I am not a 'white nationalist', I am more generally accepting of voluntarily association (which is a Libertarian value). I think its okay for people to want to build societies for their people, whether that's Asians, Jews, Blacks etc. In an an-cap system, maybe some Jews want to create a Jewish community that upholds Jewish ideas, that's fine by me, as long as they don't use violence against others. 

Lets take a scenario. We live in an-cap society, 100 ethnic Jews decide to go find some unclaimed land and build a Jewish settlement. They all agree to entry criteria for their settlement, stipulating that people must be ethnically Jewish. They still trade with everyone, they don't attack anyone, they just live peacefully. What is wrong with this?

Now I see where your fears come from, I don't think you can turn a currently mixed state into an 'ethnostate' without a lot of violence. I don't see the US ever becoming an ethnostate and I wouldn't want that. I think the most likely scenario would be a state like NH seceding and then just enforcing strict immigration laws, which again, don't lead to tyranny, see Japan, Switzerland etc. You don't need rules against race mixing or anything, that is outdated nonsense and tyrannical.

Now lets discuss the term 'racist', its a useless term in its current usage. 

""a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another.""

that is Google's definition. So lets break it down. Discrimination is defined as unjust or prejudicial treatment. The idea of prejudice is dumb because its not actually 'pre' 'judice' its 'post' 'judice'. In another comment I referenced a study showing that most stereotypes of races, gender etc are actually accurate predictors. 

So making accurate group based predictions is one criteria. 

So anyone who believes that Jews are better at language based skills is a 'racist'. Anyone who believes that Asians perform better than Whites in the US is racist. Anyone who believes that Chinese people are smarter than Brits is racist. See how utterly meaningless that makes the term?

When you can lump a hardcore skinhead racist under the same banner as a democrat who believes Jews are good writers, you make the term pointless. What do you actually gain from knowing someone is a racist, it tells you nothing about their actions and very little about their beliefs. The definition doesn't even stipulate whether they believe its based on environment or genes. Going by this definition you could have a hardcore environmental determinist egalitarian being called a 'racist' for accepting statistics. 

How is me saying ""Ashkenazi Jews are more likely to be better writers"" any worse than me saying ""men are more likely to be violent"" or ""teenagers are more likely to need more sleep than adults""? Insurance companies charge men more based on the data, is this wrong? I don't think so. They are accurately predicting behaviour, not for everyone obviously, being individualistic 100% of the time is impossible. An insurance company cannot do a detailed personality, IQ test and counselling for every single person. So lets change the situation, an insurance company charges blacks living in the inner city more for insurance, is this wrong? We know they are vastly more likely to commit crime and live in crime ridden areas, it would be as accurate as assumptions about male drivers. But because its 'racist' its somehow worse.

I've run out of room, so please wait until PART 2 of my reply.

Congratulations, you've quoted old testament law at new testament believers. If everything were done they way it were written it'd be the Jews doing that, not the Christians. 

Much of the old testament was included in the Bible not because it is to be followed literally, but because it is a significant piece of the history of the faith. What defines a Christian comes mostly from Paul's letters (but the New testament at large is part of it).

But the new testament talks about the fulfillment of prophecy. To know what that prophecy is, you've got to roll on back and read the old testament. Not necessarily live it out. 

As an added bonus, you chose stoning as the method of execution, which ties in quite well with:

""And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, 'Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.'"" John 8:7, ESV.

So here, Jesus puts forth that those riddled with sin are not the ones able to cast punishment on those also guilty of sin. Or at least the punishment of death, as the context would provide. 

So you say that if we took it literally we'd be stoning people in the streets, but if we take this literally as well then it directs we would not.

He wrote the book Aborting America where he first exposed what he called ""the dishonest beginnings of the abortion movement."" In 1984, he directed and narrated a film titled The Silent Scream, in cooperation with the National Right to Life Committee, which contained the ultrasound video of a mid term (12 weeks) abortion. His second documentary Eclipse of Reason dealt with late-term abortions. He stated that the numbers he once cited for NARAL concerning the number of deaths linked to illegal abortions were ""false figures.""

>Most poor people didn't see enough reason to vote, and a lot of poor people voted for trump even if Clinton won more of them. Trump just won among the upper classes *disproportionately*. That's true of fascist and proto-fascist movements generally. In Germany the Nazis did exceptionally well in comfortable or wealthy urban areas hostile to liberals, socialists, and particularly communists. They were seen as the bulwark against the left as the centre collapsed. That was, very disproportionately, who they appealed to. Numerically, however, the bulk of their voters were ordinary rural Protestants, primarily interested in ending the depression, debt relief, 'restoring Germany' - a lot of this got directed at Jews as a scapegoat, obviously. Richard Hamiltons great study compares the results with other cases and finds organisational issues were key, and that social-democratic parties won over similar constituencies in, say, Scandinavian countries (places where no new movement appeared just saw voters punish the incumbent administration by voting in the opposition).

>The point is I think most people have a bad, overly simplistic view of the election. Obviously anyone talking about this like Trumps election was a 'working class revolt' is talking absolute shit. In fact, for me what's most important of all is the huge non-voting bloc. Trump was able to muddy the waters enough that even faced with *him* Democrats actually *lost* voters to the massive section of Americans who just don't vote and (rightfully) think 'politics' is bullshit. That said you do have the (not large - but certainly significant given it adds up to millions of people) group that voted obama (many twice) who switched to trump. That's a canary in the coal mine for me.

>Then you have the chuds. The real, motivated base of the GOP, who are comfortable, bog standard republicans. And yeah, disproportionately that's who voted trump. They're fucking reactionary scum. 

>But it's weird to say ""poor people voted Clinton, not trump"" when you mean ""more poor people voted Clinton than trump"".

Suggerisco a te l'uso degli occhiali: questa citazione ""testuale"" [non compare](https://i.imgur.com/1LU5ji6.png) nel tuo post. In alternativa agli occhiali potrebbe giovare un dizionario, alla voce ""testuale""; oppure, meglio ancora, una buona dose di onest√† per ammettere che avevi straparlato dicendo ""ho citato testualmente"", quando quello che hai fatto √® parafrasare ;)

> Sulla competenza: se appunto non stava al sindaco a decidere, ha straparlato solo per farci bella figura.

Si chiama ""dialogo istituzionale"", una figura istituzionale pu√≤ chiedere a un'altra di decidere in un certo modo. Ad esempio, il sindaco di una citt√† portuale al largo della quale si trova una nave che non ha al momento il permesso di attraccare pu√≤ *chiedere* che gli venga concesso.

> perch√© non mi mostri tu dove dice di volerli accogliere in citt√†?

Mmmmh no, sei tu che devi dimostrare quello che hai detto, cio√© che il sindaco di Pozzallo non li vuole.

> Se non sai dimostrarlo, perch√© tu sei uno di quelli tristi che √® nel giusto e quindi non deve dimostrare nulla, almeno ammettilo.

Veramente sei tu che hai fatto un'affermazione, per essere precisi un'insinuazione sulle intenzioni del sindaco, e sei tenuto a dimostrarla. Per esempio, poco sopra dici ""ha straparlato **solo per farci bella figura**"". Mi dimostreresti questa cosa?

In alternativa, se non ti √® possibile dimostrare gli intenti altrui, mi spieghi perch√© invece pretendi da me questo genere di dimostrazione e mi dai di ""uno di quelli tristi"" (lol) nel caso non fossi in grado di dartela?

If you're staying a few days, I'd probably recommend Springdale to avoid having to drive every day.  You can take a (free) bus straight from the main street of the town into Zion, and you can end your day with a nice meal at one of the touristy restaurants.

St. George feels like every other small American town, which isn't necessarily bad but doesn't quite feel like a *vacation* for me.

food,i.redd.it,KirstenSanDiego,[homemade] caprese salad with extra virgin olive oil and traditionally produced balsamic vinegar.,1,13491746,Zeno_The_Alien,533814059,30555367676,"Flavor is the most noticeable difference. Good olive oil is also just a cleaner taste. Here are some tips for finding good olive oil. 

 - Check the ""harvest date"" on bottles of EVOO next time you're at the store. A lot of olive oil companies mix their new harvest oil with old oil from previous harvest seasons, and it gives it a rank smell and taste that, unfortunately, is so common that most people don't know it's not supposed to smell and taste that way.
 - Don't buy cheap stuff. It's a dead giveaway that you're getting garbage. That being said...
 - Expensive doesn't always mean good. Again, check the harvest and press date. Which brings us to...
 - Examine the label thoroughly. Real, quality, Italian olive oil will give you a lot of info on where it was made and who made it. From the city/town in Italy, to the olive grower, to the type of olive.
 - It doesn't actually have to come from Italy to be good quality stuff. If you live in California, you might have an olive mill that you can make a trip to and get the real deal for good stuff. If not, then you probably have a farmers market that sells it. And if the bottle says it's from Australia, buy that shit. Australia has the strictest rules for the production of olive oil. Chile is a close second.

As for balsamic... I can't begin to describe how mind blowingly different good quality balsamic is from the average stuff. You can drink it straight up. In fact, you *really want to*, because it's that good. If the label doesn't say *Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale* and have a D.O.P. (""*Denominazione di Origine Protetta*"") stamp, it's not true, authentic, balsamic vinegar. It can get expensive (upwards of $200 an ounce), but doesn't necessarily have to be. Shop around online and you can find pretty good deals.

If you make the plunge and get some good quality oil and balsamic, make two plates of caprisi salad. One with standard oil and balsamic, and one with the good stuff. Do a side by side taste comparison. Hell, do a blindfolded comparison. I promise you that you will never go back.

>During the Civil War more than 130 Alabama Jews served in the Confederate Army, and in 1861, when 13 of them enlisted as a group in the Twelfth Alabama Regiment, Mobile Jews held a special service. James K. Gutheim, however, went to Montgomery as an exile rather than take the oath of allegiance to the [United States](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/usatoc.html) after New Orleans' occupation by federal forces. He served in Montgomery and in nearby towns until the end of the Civil War.Judah P. Benjamin lived in Montgomery during his tenure as attorney general of the Confederacy, and the last soldier killed in the defense of Mobile was a Jew from [South Carolina](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/states/SC.html). The congregations in Mobile and Montgomery, like virtually all of the older Southern congregations, turned to Reform following the Civil War, joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations after its creation in 1873, and were served by graduates of the [Hebrew Union College](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08632.html).  
>  
>Eastern European immigrants began to arrive in Alabama towns early in the 1870s. They were treated with a combination of philanthropic generosity and social aloofness, which persisted longer in tradition-conscious southern communities than in the northern communities. These immigrants created their own Orthodox congregations in Mobile, Montgomery, and [Birmingham](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_03002.html), most of which joined the Conservative movement following [World War II](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/wwtoc.html).  
>  
>Jewish merchants were found in most Alabama towns of any size, with synagogues springing up in small mining towns like West Blocton and Bessemer, and larger cities like Selma. Immigrants often began selling house to house, saving enough money to buy a cart, then rent a storefront.  
>  
>The town of Sheffield was founded in 1884 by a land company that included the Moses brothers of Montgomery. Falkville was named for Louis Faulk, who was the first merchant and postmaster, and Saks was established for area tenant farmers by Joseph Saks, founder of a clothing store in Anniston.

As Jewish immigration into New York increased in the 1880s and 1890s, it's possible they would have been more attracted to that area. Or perhaps family immigrated and stayed in New York and your family wanted to join them. Larry David found out on Finding Your Roots that he descends from a German-Jewish southern  line that, after the Civil War, made their way north to New York.

Not really a recommendation on saving money but I highly recommend packing cubes. It will make your luggage incredibly more organized and you won't have to ruin your folding trying to hunt down a specific item. I used these on a long trip to Europe and they seemed silly before I used them but they are amazing. Feel like I spent half the time I usually do packing and repacking.

> Anything special we should be looking at? Not looking to stay in the most extravagant of places, but I cannot do couch surfing, hostels, or anything along those lines..

Just do your research maybe a week or two in advanced and make sure there isn't a festival, conference or something driving up prices. Reroute yourself accordingly if you can Also look into reservation and parking requirements at parks if you are going to camp, especially at the South Rim Grand Canyon, Zion, Yellowstone and Yosemite. Many campsites fill up months in advanced. There are options outside of the parks, but it may be less convenient (trafffic going into the park everyday, parking, commute, etc) 


> Is there a way to stay in Hotels a smart way in that town?

Not sure what you mean by ""smart way"" but avoid fight weekends and big conferences. Usually it's pretty obvious when you look at hotels. 4 stars on the strip are usually $100-200 during low season and get cheaper during the week, during a fight weekend they'll be $500+. You can get rooms for dirt cheap (like sub $50) in Vegas since there's so many hotels. The further off the strip the cheaper. I personally like staying on the strip and would recommend it for a first (and maybe last) timer, but if you are looking to save look to stay just off it and hotel rooms will be half the price or more. There are also lots of airbnb options in Vegas. 

For the CA coast look into staying in Carmel/Monterrey for a few days (Monterrey will be cheaper), Big Sur, San Luis Obispo area, and Santa Barbara",2018-06-26 17:10:13 UTC,1,0,/r/travel/comments/8u1mgu/job_ends_this_week_traveling_us_insighttips_are/e1bv3d0/

Powerful demonstration of selective reasoning that is easily dismissed.

Jesus never once told anyone to kill in his name.

Buddha never ONCE told ANYONE to kill.

There's nothing in the Dao De Jing calling for violence.

All your examples of non-muslims committing violence are them doing stuff that their religion does not say to do (not sure about Hinduism, there are some violent gods but they seem to have a stable society)(not sure about Jews, I'd consider an argument there).  When muslims commit violence, they can easily cite very very very many clear, unambiguous text that they are required to believe and obey unto death, which very specifically and clearly state that they SHOULD do those things.

No idea who that is, but that's a club shirt, not an NT one. 
You seem to be deliberately misreading my words, these players aren't ashamed to play for their NT like Shaqiri,Xhaka, they can boast their national symbols for clubs as long as they like, but they dont do it for other **national teams**, which is the point of the issue. Albania didn't play this WC, like it never did and they did it while playing for the **Swiss national team** that's the issue.

Nice argument, shame you couldn't come up with counterarguments.

You can't reify that into ""conservative values"", declare it anathema, and somehow purge N different personality-affecting alleles from the fucking gene pool, any more than you can feasibly purge immigrants or Jews from the gene pool in a modern society.

I was thinking the same thing. Certain moral tendencies seem to have been around in one form or another with various justifications for all of human history, you can't make them go away just by wiping out a particular ideology. If your ideology wins that means the next generation of people with those psychological predispositions are increasingly on *your team*, and the fight to defeat the external threat is replaced by them co-opting all your institutions,  political rhetoric, and built-up moral authority. Of course some people have argued that this is already happening, myself included. To take a random recent example, when a top employee for Netflix is [fired](http://archive.is/ysEAc) for using the word ""nigger"" descriptively in a discussion of offensive material in comedy, that hardly seems unrelated to whatever personality features made a subset of people deeply care about using the Lord's name in vain. Or the countless denunciations of ~~obscene~~ problematic and toxic media. To take another recent example, regarding a game depicting Hell of the exact sort that would have once inspired primarily conservative-flavored media outrage:

[Vice Waypoint: Agony, a Game About Dehumanizing Women, Isn't Just Bad, It's Toxic](https://archive.fo/vfh7L)

>Agony is the kind of game conservative culture warriors will defend not because it's good, but because it ""offends"" people. If someone's upset over the way it depicts women, who cares if it's no fun to play? In today's Trump-fueled victimhood culture, that's basically a win.

Consider how deeply weird this sentiment would have seemed not too long ago. ""Conservatives"" are the ones who reflexively defend horror media filled with grotesque sexuality and violence?

>It's worth asking whether Agony falls under the same category as Hatred, the 2015 top-down action game that glamorized mass shootings. By writing about it, aren't you just giving it the craved attention? Hatred was the heir apparent to Postal, a game whose trolly nature now seems like an antiquated version of today's ""trolling the libs.""

I'd be interested in if people at the time regarded the backlash against Postal and Postal 2 as being a liberal thing, because I definitely viewed it as vaguely conservative. Which would imply that the ""antiquated version of today's trolling the libs"" was trolling the cons. I know then-Democratic Senator Lieberman was the most vocal voice against it, but the Democratic politicians didn't feel representative of the liberal zeitgeist, or at least the young liberal zeitgeist. (Incidentally, if the obscure Agony isn't what Klepek considers unworthy of attention, what is? The answer is Kingdom Come: Deliverance, an RPG that sold millions of copies but that Waypoint [explicitly said](http://archive.is/p6CD8) they wouldn't cover because the game set in 1403 Bohemia doesn't have black people and because the developer is pro-GG.)

Everyone back then seemed to think it was just a matter of young liberal internet-savvy people supplanting the old conservative Christian moralists - but it doesn't seem to be working out that way. The internet was the way it was because of selection effects, so the rise of the internet didn't mean the rise of the people that once dominated it, it means the end of that distinctiveness. Old-school conservatism failing among young people doesn't mean victory against conservative-style morality, it means that a lot more of those people are driving forces in liberalism now, while many people with the personality types that used to be at the core become alienated from it to various degrees. I think there are probably ways to set up cultural institutions that are more resilient against people with ""conservative morality"" gaining the power to enforce it, but ""indoctrinate children away from conservatism as hard as possible"" clearly isn't it.",2018-06-26 17:03:32 UTC,1,0,/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8tpcyn/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_25_2018/e1bumbe/

> I‚Äôm afraid that Palestine is denying its own right to ‚Äúexist‚Äù by repeatedly, illogically and hopelessly denying the right of Israel to exist ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea Palestine will be free‚Äù. Hmmm...

There is a massive difference between slogans and aspirations and control with overwhelming power. E.g., in the latest round the Israelis killed and wounded **over ten thousand** people for, in the main, singing. It was patently obvious to any onlooker that there was no real risk to any Israelis, as shown by the fact that for the thousands of Palestinians killed and wounded, 1 Israeli soldier was scratched.

Thus, there is no symmetry. Currently and for the last century, Israel has been busy depopulating Palestine from its indigenous inhabitants, destroying their homes and replacing them with settlers. In practice, on the ground. Intentionally and proactively. 

I do not think that any sane person can compare this to slogans, regardless of what they say.

The fact is that with all the talk of ""denial of the right to exist"", Israel exists and Palestine does not, the Israelis are expanding and the Palestinians concentrated in a huge prison, denied the most basic human rights. In practice, the Israeli policies are entrenching this and making the situation irreversible through their own actions. No amount of victim blaming can change the fact that the Israelis have all the initiative and all the action. The Palestinians can barely do anything except try to survive in their homeland, with very limited success.

> Israel has repeatedly offered deal after deal to the Palestinians, who instead allow a bunch of fanatical Islamists to run Gaza.

Not sure what ""deals"" you are referring to, since none were ever formally and properly offered. E.g., Barak's so-called ""generous offer"" was never formally made. Ulmert's offer was given on the condition of immediate acceptance with no discussion nor even time to discuss. These ""offers"" were in a word mythical, with absolutely no objective except to be used as propaganda ‚Äî¬†as you are using them now. The same, BTW, can be said about the Zionists acceptance of the ""partition plan"", which they accepted after it was patently obvious that the Palestinians had already rejected it (as well they should have ‚Äî¬†no indigenous people would have accepted surrender). The Zionists then proceeded to depopulate Palestine through a carefully executed campaign of terror and ethnic cleansing that they had been planning since the early 1940's.

In addition, none of these so-called ""offers"" included any of the fundamental requirements:

1. Recognition of the internationally recognised Right of Return.
2. Sovereignty.
3. A viable state.
4. Capital in Jerusalem.
5. Equality for the Palestinian citizens of Israel.

Thus all of these so-called ""offers"" were simply terms of surrender. 

> There will be no solution absent a two state solution

Israel has been busy making the two-states impossible. That is a done deal. Their current objective is apartheid, containment, repression and expulsion, which are the cornerstones of their current strategy. I do not think there will be an agreed solution. There will be an outcome that may include an Israeli attempt to ethnically cleanse the rest of Palestine, 

> - and by the way, when jews say ‚Äúnever again‚Äù they really, really mean it,

What has this to do with anything? Israel has one of the most powerful militaries on the planet and is busy murdering Palestinians in their thousands and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity on a daily basis. Are you seriously trying to portray them as at risk? The is ludicrous. Not weird. Absolutely fucking bonkers.

> I'm a lifelong labour supporting (now ex member) UK Jewish resident who has been to Israel once in my entire life, almost 30 years ago.

You should check it out. Might enlighten you to what massive, brutal repression looks like and what a rabidly-racist society and state look like.

> Who detests Bibi, btw.

Bibi is no worse than Lapid, Bennet, Barak or Leiberman and only a bit worse than Olmert and Perese. Most of whom are famous war criminals in their own rights.

> I'm hardly anyone's definition of ""hasbara"".

You certainly sound like one. Do your fact checking, read some history, abandon the bullshit talking points, victim blaming, self-victimhood, sanctimony and hypocrisy and maybe that will sound credible.

> ... hard to understand the invective aimed at Israel by those who utterly and complete ignore the ""wrongdoings"" of literally every other state in the entire world

**The** classic *hasbara* argument, as if there is an ""equal time"" requirement combined together with a dose of ""whataboutism"". Is that what you told those that marched against apartheid back in the 80's? I have a strong interest in Israel-Palestine for a number of reasons, that are not relevant to a political debate. What of it? This is simply a request from one set of criminals for everyone to ignore their massive century-long criminality because there are others that are also criminals. If you are British, I am sure you know that this is not a defense in UK law. It is, BTW, in Israeli law, where soldiers have successfully defended themselves against charges of homicide because most killings of Palestinians in the OPT never lead to indictments.

Israel is not only very much the exceptionalist, but also the exception. While it has no monopoly on brutality, it is the only current colonialist entity carrying out an active campaign of ethnic cleansing against a defenceless, colonized indigenous nation, with the possible exception of Myanmar. It is the longest standing such entity, carrying out its crimes for a century and counting, holding multiple generations of indigenous people as subservient, oppressed, brutalised slaves, with the expressed intent of continuing to do this indefinitely. There are several other crimes that make it unique. One of the most insidious is its ongoing campaign to limit the political freedoms ‚Äî¬†mainly freedom of expression ‚Äî¬†of the citizens of many countries (most notably the USA and UK) so as to make criticism and peaceful political action against them illegal.

> and evinces sympathy for a bunch a fundamentalist terrorists who (somewhat optimistically) desire the destruction of Israel and everyone in it - so I have to question the sanity of those who think this world view is all perfectly fine, whilst at the same time accusing Israel of pursuing the reverse agenda - which it plainly isn't!!!!

The Palestinians are not ""a bunch a fundamentalist terrorists"". That is a racist statement. They are a nation suffering a century of repression, brutalisation and terror from a vastly more powerful enemy. How can you look at the latest Gaza massacre ‚Äî¬†thousands shot and over a hundred killed for the simple act of asserting their *universally recognised right to return to their homes which they fled as refugees from the terror* of the Nakba and Nakhsa through demonstrations ‚Äî and call the **victims** terrorists? Do you not think that in the eyes of any sane and objective onlooker the only terrorists in this equation are the IDF ‚Äî brutalising, repressing and blighting the lives of 5 million innocent human beings? Have you no shame? 

As for ""destruction of Israel"". This is sanctimonious beyond belief. The only people currently and actively being destroyed on a daily basis are the Palestinians. The ratio of dead is 100-to-1 in *favour* of the Israelis and you are trying to portray them as victims? Is it any wonder you are open to accusations of being *hasbara*?

Also, slavery was a society issue. The Bible was written to be adapted to society as it changed. It‚Äôs why the New Testament clearly states Old Testament law is for history and is no longer the building blocks of Christianity. The Old Testament was always meant for reference of the culture the New Testament was written during. It‚Äôs like reading a history book at the same time as the Declaration of Independence. It‚Äôs context not law. On top of that, if you legit study it, you‚Äôll see slavery was typically a legal contract for work with protections built in for the slave to still be seen as a person. Most of the time slaves were just people trying to repay debts. They‚Äôd amass a shit ton of debt they couldn‚Äôt pay back and instead of going to prison or having their families lives ruined, the man he owed would be responsible for paying taking care of the indebted person‚Äôs family while he worked for the next 7 years of so to pay back what he owed. The slave wasn‚Äôt to be beaten, abused or treated like scum. They were a protected class and if they died the contract owner was held responsible financially and legally for that person under their employ. 

Now, does the Old Testament have some questionable stuff, to some sure. But, remember, the Old Testament was the rules of a society long dead and gone.

DebateReligion,self.DebateReligion,g3t_re4l,Why the Trinity is Polytheism,1,53299,g3t_re4l,531264526,30555316469,"The root word from where the word Messiah comes, you'll find that it means to ""anoint"" and when applied to a person, it's the ""anointed one"". It was used to signify a status of an individual, where a priest was anointed, or a king was anointed. The Greeks translated the word into Christos, which is where the word Christ came from. In the current context, the Messiah is referring to a person chosen by God, the word Messiah being used as a title. 

We see this when John was approached by the Jews:

**John 1**

>\[**19\]**¬†And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

John was very righteous and also used to preach, being the son of Zakariah the Prophet. So the Jews wanted to know who he was and his status. Was he the Messiah, Christ.

>\[**20\]**¬†And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

He denied being the Christ. Therefore it is understood that the Christ is a title given to a Prophet who they were told about and awaiting. The next verse is also interesting:

>\[**21\]**¬†And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

They asked him who he was, Elias, or ""that prophet"". From this we understand that not only were they awaiting the Messiah, they were also awaiting another Prophet, ""that prophet"". 

Further to confirm that the Christ, the Messiah is just a Prophet given the title of Messiah, they asked John:

> \[**25\]**¬†And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? 

They understood that baptizing was done by a Prophet, therefore they asked if he was one of the 3 individuals, including the Christ and ""that prophet"". John was a Prophet, but they wanted to know about 3 specific ones. 

An interesting question though considering Jesus(pbuh) is the Messiah, who is this ""that prophet"" who the Jews were expecting yet hadn't come yet. A Prophet to come after Jesus(pbuh). The Bible gives a very big clue to who it is.",2018-06-26 17:01:29 UTC,1,0,/r/DebateReligion/comments/8sauby/why_the_trinity_is_polytheism/e1buh2t/

When all truth has already been revealed by Tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.


""The Rejection of modernism"", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.


""The Cult of Action for Action's Sake"", which dictates that action is of value in itself, and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.


""Disagreement Is Treason"" ‚Äì Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.


""Fear of Difference"", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.


""Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class"", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.


""Obsession with a Plot"" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society (such as the German elite's 'fear' of the 1930s Jewish populace's businesses and well-doings; see also anti-Semitism). Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.
Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as ""at the same time too strong and too weak."" On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.


""Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy"" because ""Life is Permanent Warfare"" ‚Äì there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to NOT build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.


""Contempt for the Weak"", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate Leader who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.


""Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero"", which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, ""[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.""


""Machismo"", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold ""both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.""


""Selective Populism"" ‚Äì The People, conceived monolithically, have a Common Will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the Leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of ""no longer represent[ing] the Voice of the People.""


""Newspeak"" ‚Äì Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.

""Trump appears to take aspects of his German background seriously. John Walter works for the Trump Organization, and when he visits Donald in his office, Ivana told a friend, he clicks his heels and says, ‚ÄúHeil¬†Hitler,‚Äù possibly as a family joke.

Last April, perhaps in a surge of Czech nationalism, Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler‚Äôs collected speeches,¬†My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of¬†My New Order¬†in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler‚Äôs speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist.

‚ÄúDid your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?‚Äù I asked Trump.

Trump hesitated. ‚ÄúWho told you that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúActually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of¬†Mein Kampf, and he‚Äôs a Jew.‚Äù (‚ÄúI did give him a book about Hitler,‚Äù Marty Davis said. ‚ÄúBut it was¬†My New Order, Hitler‚Äôs speeches, not¬†Mein Kampf.¬†I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I‚Äôm not Jewish.‚Äù)

Later, Trump returned to this subject. ‚ÄúIf¬†I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.‚Äù

Is Ivana trying to convince her friends and lawyer that Trump is a crypto-Nazi? Trump is no reader or history buff. Perhaps his possession of Hitler‚Äôs speeches merely indicates an interest in Hitler‚Äôs genius at propaganda.""",2018-06-26 16:58:13 UTC,1,0,/r/uspolitics/comments/8tz5e8/donald_trump_kept_book_of_adolf_hitlers_speeches/e1bu8ow/

IsraelPalestine,self.IsraelPalestine,rosinthebow2,Historical Precedent for Destroying a Nation-State,1,2387,FAREEQAWAL,534113723,30555293788,"These arguments identify specific statements or failings of individual Palestinians or their leaders as flawed. The same can be said of Israeli leaders. Of course, all humans are flawed, and perhaps men in positions of power are especially flawed. Nelson Mandela engaged in terrorism, Thomas Jefferson had coercive sex with Sally Hemings starting when she was 15 or 16, MLK was an adulterer, Churchill was a racist imperialist and Gandhi's ""tests of celibacy"" were rather weird.

We can play a tit for tat game and point to numerous failings of Israeli leaders. For example, when they found themselves in the same position as Palestinians do today (trying to remove a military power from the territory they wished to claim as a state), various Zionist factions resorted to terrorism. They planted bombs at [hotels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing), [beaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Irgun_attacks), [markets](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/06/20/93931349.html?pageNumber=9), bus-stops, [threw grenades into homes](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/12/14/87565211.html?pageNumber=1), [kidnapped](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/07/16/84540073.html?pageNumber=9) and killed soldiers/policemen and hundreds of civilians in the 1930s and 1940s. They led incidents of international terrorism, attacking [trains](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9504E7D81631E13BBC4E52DFBE66838C659EDE) and [hotels](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/08/20/104330429.html?pageNumber=11) in Europe after the war. The leaders of two Jewish terror organizations (Irgun and Lehi, which were [absorbed](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/05/07/86900739.html?pageNumber=9)into the IDF) went on to become Israeli Prime Ministers, [Menachem Begin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Begin#Jewish_underground) and [Yitzhak Shamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shamir#Zionist_activism). Shamir as co-head of Lehi ordered the assassination of [Count Folke Bernadotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folke_Bernadotte), UN mediator for the partition of Palestine, because of fears Bernadotte would [recommend](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/07/13/85254673.html?pageNumber=17) the partition plan be shelved since hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been expelled in violation of the terms (Israeli officials had [denounced](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1948/07/12/88121089.html?pageNumber=7)Bernadotte's reports). A third future prime minister, Ariel Sharon, led troops in attacks where they [dynamited homes and schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon#Unit_101), killing dozens of civilians. The mainstream Haganah itself carried out attacks that can only be described as terrorism, including an [attack on an orange grove](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/08/16/87806964.html?pageNumber=1) on August 15, 1947 which killed 11, including an entire family of seven (four of them children) who died asleep as their house was blown up with dynamite. In an echo of that operation, today's IDF uses US made bombs to destroy [houses and entire families](http://972mag.com/photos-a-gaza-funeral-for-24-members-of-one-family/94069/).

The appropriate response to all claims about vile leaders is to ask whether they have any bearing on the rights of ordinary Palestinians and Israelis.

Like when during the Second world war Hitler is the sole person to be blamed for the shit that went on there. Killed millions of Jews, all because he hated them and did everything in his power to subdue the population like he did on the night of the long knives. Look it's the person in the top that is responsible for it. 

Now let me put that in modern terms. The CEO of Yahoo came on board from Google there was a positive vibe that things were going to turn for Yahoo. But 5 years later she had to resigne and yahoo merged with Verizon. Why? Ckz she thanked the entire company with here stupid ideas and mismanagement. Who took responsibility it's the top boss. When they are put in a power role they have to ensure nothing bad Happens to the company if it does they pay the price. They need to be pointed for their laps in policy and management . Here too Modi need to be answerable.

If a person does not dislike Muslims they would not do anything. This is highly antidotal, propaganda playing on the news every day pointing at Pakistan as the enemy. Has India tried a different approach ? I don't think so, neither the government of Pakistan wants to be friends with India and the same for India too. This way they always have a boogy man to scare the people with . 

Propaganda has been a great tool for government to sway public openions and thought process. So saying that a person not inclined to kill Muslims would most likely kill if the right propaganda is sent. 

Partizan politics with the BJP and RSS got a stepping stool because of Modi, because of him hate speeches and hate crimes are increasing day by day. And Modi is bussy touring Nations to build a shitty foreign policy that allows China to grab prime real-estate to build roads and ports in our neighborhood. All this looks like Modi is not bothered by the killings. In a democracy we need to hold the highest office accountable.

> You are equating sex and gender. Whether or not someone has a particular chromosome, or was born with a particular set of sex organs, is rarely what is at issue.

I said very explicitly in my original post, quote:

* ""a male after going through transition therapy does not become a female""

If we're going to go by the Newspeak leftist redefinition of the word ""gender"" to be completely separate from sex (which it isn't, but we'll entertain that idea for a moment for the sake of discussion), then I still used the identifiers ""male"" and ""female,"" which even according to leftists are identifiers of sex, not gender.  The fact is, a male (sex) does not become a female (sex) after they transition.  You cannot change your sex.  I'm not even touching the gender/gender identity issue right now--we just need to agree that you cannot change your biological sex.

> I suspect that you are especially critical of Islam.

And why do you suspect that?  Oh, that's right, because you're a leftist.  You are basing that opinion on no evidence other than your own ideological presuppositions.

What anti-Islamic sentiment fuels American policy, exactly?  And what policies have come out of it?  If such a large part of American policy is shaped by anti-Islamic sentiment, surely you can name me 10 governmental policies that were solely shaped by anti-Islamic sentiment, with no other political, social, or economic forces at play?

He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned. While in jail he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (""My Struggle""). After his release from prison in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.

By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority, and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. This led to former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuading President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans which gave him significant popular support.

Hitler sought Lebensraum (""living space"") for the German people in Eastern Europe and his aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his long-time lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.

Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (sub-humans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.

This attack occurred at a Hypercacher kosher supermarket in Porte de Vincennes (20th arrondissement of Paris) in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shooting two days earlier, and concurrently with the Dammartin-en-Go√´le hostage crisis in which the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen were cornered.

Amedy Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and was a close friend of Sa√Ød Kouachi and Ch√©rif Kouachi (whom he had met in jail in 2005), the gunmen in the Charlie Hebdo attack. Armed with a submachine gun, an assault rifle, and two Tokarev pistols, he entered and attacked the people in the kosher food supermarket. Coulibaly murdered four Jewish hostages, and held fifteen other hostages during a siege in which he demanded that the Kouachi brothers not be harmed.

The jewish portion of the Holocaust won't even make it to the Top 10 of all genocide atrocities, yet we are constantly being brainwashed with for the last 75 years, because clearly the genocide of other races don't matter.

The Jewish genocide under Hitler is the most famous genocide in history not because it was the biggest or the worst, but because it was relatively recent and there is an enormous amount of information about it that has been uncovered, Particularly pertaining to its planning and the logistics of its execution. This makes it a great study case for scholars and historians to analyze how genocide happens and how it can be prevented in the future. As such most books and essays written on the holocaust focus on the Jewish genocide because we simply don‚Äôt have as much information about the other atrocities carried out by the Nazis, and what we do have is mostly fragmented and of questionable accuracy. Fuck off with your ‚ÄúJewish supremacy‚Äù
BS. If you must blame a tiny ethnic and religious minority in Europe for all your problems do so in designated hate subs such as r/milliondollarextreeme or r/cringeanarchy.

Other differences: Germans widely perceived the Nazis as uncultured thugs (a stereotype that excepted the former Viennese art student at the top).

The first German-Soviet pact, for secret weapons development in Soviet Russia away from the Allies' prying eyes, was signed *before* the Treaty of Versailles, before the NSDAP even existed.

Religious opposition to gay marriage is credible, and in many cases it's unconnected to prejudice. Sure, there are a lot of people who are prejudiced against gays, but there is also the crowd that views gays the way Muslims view people who drink alcohol or Jews view people who consume pork - there's no deep seeded prejudice, it's truly just their religion.

The Rising Sun flag isn't censored and people still wehraboo the shit out of the Japanese. The Hammer and Sickle aren't censored and you have both tankies and communists as well as people who are very well aware the Soviets were nasty (I don't know too much about Eastern European media culture, and as an outsider they look like they are just taking advantage of history for their own xenophobic agendas).

Shying away from atrocities I think does more to whitewash these countries in video games rather than just censoring the flag. Very few games depict the Holocaust, slavery, and general horrors of war wrought upon civilians. Unfortunately, games need to sell, and if you are being too critical of Japan or the USSR, it isn't selling. I feel like Germany is such an anomaly, it is actually unusual that criticizing a nationalist xenophobic regimes gets a product to sell BETTER.

Personally, I think political commentary has its greatest affect in more fantastic or distant settings. I even think Wolfenstein needed to be over the top to be able to portray the horrible aspects of the Nazis (and Wolfenstein is still pretty tame). In Paradox games for example, EU4, Victoria II, and HoI can't tread too close to collective memory. The horrors of imperialism aren't depicted in Vic II besides the one off Heart of Darkness event. In HoI there are no civilian casualties, and no Holocaust. EU4 I think is ok. Meanwhile in CKII you can raze entire cities to the ground as pagan tribes, expel the Jews, abuse children, etc. and in Stellaris you can bring entire sapient species to their extinction. Of course, the disadvantage of this is that CKII and Stellaris atrocities are more comical than tragic.",2018-06-26 16:30:38 UTC,1,0,/r/ShitWehraboosSay/comments/8u15j9/should_nazi_symbols_be_censored_in_games/e1bs9qx/
